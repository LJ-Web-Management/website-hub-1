      description: "An excavator hits a gas line. What the first crew on scene should and shouldn't do.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [592, 1056],
      body: `A third-party excavator hits a gas service line. Gas is blowing. Your crew is first on scene. Every utility has its own procedures, so follow yours. These principles are common to most.

## Do

1. **Call 911** and your gas control or dispatch.
2. **Evacuate** people from nearby buildings and keep the public back, upwind.
3. **Eliminate ignition sources.** No smoking, no starting vehicles in the area, no operating switches, doorbells or phones close to the leak.
4. **Monitor** with a combustible gas indicator at the perimeter and nearby buildings, especially basements.
5. **Let qualified crews control the gas** by closing valves or squeezing off the line, following company procedures.

## Don't

- Try to plug or bury the leak, or let the excavator operator do it
- Shut off equipment near the leak if that could cause a spark. Leave it running and walk away.
- Assume outdoor gas stays outside. It migrates through soil and into buildings along utility trenches.
- Go back in until readings confirm it's safe

## Afterward

Report the damage under your state's one-call rules. Most strikes are preventable: call 811 before digging, wait for the locates and hand-dig near marked lines.

      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [592, 1099, 593],
      body: `Utilities have their own federal safety rules (for gas pipelines, DOT's 49 CFR Parts 192 and 195, including operator qualification). HAZWOPER applies alongside them in specific situations.

## Usually not HAZWOPER

- Routine leak surveys and repairs handled under normal operating procedures
- Incidental releases that the crew can control without significant hazard

## Often HAZWOPER

- **Emergency response** to a release beyond incidental, for example a large gas release, fire, or liquids spill reaching waterways (1910.120(q))
- **Cleanup** of contaminated soil or water after a release, such as a liquids pipeline spill
- **Work in contaminated rights-of-way**, for example former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites

## Typical training by role

| Role | Training |
|---|---|
| Meter readers, locators, inspectors | [[1099]] |
| Field crews who respond to emergencies | [[592]] and annual refresher |
| Supervisors and on-call managers | [[593]] |
| Leak investigators | Gas detection: [[1056]] |

## Operator qualification is separate

DOT operator qualification covers specific covered tasks on pipelines. It doesn't replace HAZWOPER, and HAZWOPER doesn't replace it.`,

      description: "At a utility emergency, you'll rarely be in charge alone. How to be useful at the command post.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [593, 574],
      body: `When a gas main fails or a substation burns, the fire department usually arrives first and establishes incident command. The utility's job is to bring the knowledge only it has.

## What unified command means

Agencies and organizations with responsibility for the incident share command and agree on objectives. The fire department leads life safety, the utility leads controlling its system, and police lead traffic and perimeter.

## What the utility representative brings

- **System knowledge:** where the valves are, what feeds the area and what else will be affected by a shutdown
- **Monitoring:** combustible gas readings and their meaning
- **Time estimates:** how long to isolate, purge and restore
- **Resources:** crews, equipment and contractors on the way

## At the command post

1. Check in with the incident commander and identify yourself and your role.
2. Share what you know and what you don't. Give clear estimates.
3. Agree on objectives and who does what.
4. Keep your crews inside the incident's safety rules.

## After

Join the critique. Utilities and fire departments that train together respond better. Many hold joint tabletop exercises every year.
