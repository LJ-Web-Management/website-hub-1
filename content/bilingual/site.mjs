      description: "OSHA's policy on training language, and how employers with mixed crews put it into practice.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1100, 587],
      body: `In 2010, OSHA issued a policy stating that when its standards require training, employers must present the information **in a manner employees can understand**. That includes language and vocabulary. If a worker understands Spanish better than English, the training must work for them.

## What that means for HAZWOPER

- A 40-hour certificate isn't enough on its own if the worker didn't understand the course.
- Site safety plans, pre-entry briefings and emergency procedures also need to be understood by everyone.
- Signs, labels and alarms should be understood by the whole crew.

## Practical steps

1. **Ask workers their preferred language** for training, privately and without assumptions.
2. **Use courses in that language** where available: [[1100]] for the 40-hour in Spanish.
3. **Check understanding.** Ask workers to explain or demonstrate, not just sign a sheet.
4. **Use bilingual leads** for daily briefings, or interpret consistently.
5. **Translate the essentials** of the site safety plan: hazards, PPE by task, action levels, emergency signals and muster points.

## Literacy matters too

Some workers read less well in any language. Pictures, demonstrations and hands-on practice help everyone.

      courses: [597],
      body: `The morning tailgate is where the site safety plan meets the day's work. On a mixed-language crew, it has to work in both languages.

## Keep it short and visual

- Use the site map and point to the zones
- Hold up the actual PPE for today's tasks
- Show the monitor and say the action level out loud

## Say it twice, not half

Give each point fully in both languages, rather than switching mid-sentence. If you're not fluent, pair with a bilingual lead and agree on key terms in advance.

## Check understanding

End with two or three questions to different workers, in their language:

- What's our PPE today? / ¿Qué equipo usamos hoy?
- What reading makes us stop? / ¿Qué lectura nos hace parar?
- Where do we go if the horn sounds? / ¿A dónde vamos si suena la alarma?

## Write down the key words

Post the day's hazards and the emergency signal in both languages at the support zone.

## Supervisors

Supervisors on bilingual crews carry extra responsibility for communication. The 8-hour supervisor course ([[597]]) covers briefings and enforcement.`,

## Use it
