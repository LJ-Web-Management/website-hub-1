## Measure first

Pull a month of alarm history. Rank by count. Usually a few points cause most of the noise.

## Common causes

- **Setpoints too tight**, so normal swings alarm
- **No delay**, so a two-second blip alarms
- **Chattering**: values hovering at the limit without a deadband
- **Duplicates**: the same event alarming at several levels
- **Stale points** from removed equipment

## Fix them

1. Add sensible deadbands and time delays
2. Set priorities: critical, warning, information
3. Group related alarms so one event creates one notification
4. Remove or disable points for equipment that's gone
5. Document every change

## Keep it clean

Review the top-10 noisiest alarms every month. Aim for alarms that each require an action.

      body: `| System | Watches and controls | Main users |
|---|---|---|
| **BMS / BAS** (building management or automation system) | HVAC, chillers, air handlers, sometimes lighting and fire interfaces | Facilities, mechanical |
| **EPMS** (electrical power monitoring system) | Switchgear, UPS, generators, PDUs, power quality | Electrical, critical facilities |
| **DCIM** (data center infrastructure management) | Assets, rack space, power and cooling capacity, connectivity, sometimes pulling BMS and EPMS data | Capacity planning, operations, IT |

## How they fit

The BMS and EPMS run and protect equipment in real time. DCIM sits above them, combining their data with asset and capacity information for planning.

## Integration tips

- Agree on point naming before integration
- Decide which system is the source of truth for each data point
- Secure the networks: building systems are a cyber target too

See [[1104]] for BAS fundamentals and [[830]] for DCIM.`,
