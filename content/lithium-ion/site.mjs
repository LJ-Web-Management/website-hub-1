      body: `## Why sites switch

Smaller footprint, lighter weight, longer service life, and better tolerance of warmer rooms than VRLA.

## What changes for safety

- **Different failure mode**: thermal runaway can propagate and produce flammable, toxic gases
- **Battery management system (BMS)**: monitors cell voltage and temperature and can isolate modules. Learn its alarms
- **Off-gas detection** is increasingly used for early warning
- **Fire codes**: NFPA 855 and local fire codes set rules for energy storage systems, including spacing, quantities and suppression
- **Emergency planning**: share battery type, location and shutdown procedures with the local fire department

## Handling and disposal

Damaged lithium-ion batteries need special packaging and shipping. Spent batteries can usually be managed as universal waste ([[602]]).

      body: `## Triggers

Define what starts the plan: a BMS temperature alarm, an off-gas detector, visible smoke, or a strange smell in the battery room.

## Immediate actions

1. Don't enter a room that may contain battery gases
2. Evacuate the area and call emergency services
3. Notify the facility manager and the battery or UPS vendor
4. Isolate the affected string remotely if the procedure allows and it's safe

## Information for responders

- Battery chemistry, quantity and location
- Room layout and access
- Ventilation controls and how to operate them
- Electrical isolation points

## After the event

The battery may reignite. Keep the area monitored, and don't move damaged modules without the vendor and the fire department's agreement.

## Practice

Walk through the plan with the local fire department once a year. Learn DC basics with [[1084]].`,
