## How to use the deck

1. **Go through all the cards once.** Flip each one and say the answer out loud first.
2. **Mark what you know.** Keep studying the rest.
3. **Come back tomorrow.** Shuffle and repeat. You'll know more cards each day.
4. **Then weekly.** Before your exam, and again before your annual refresher.

## Why it works for HAZWOPER

The facts that matter in an emergency, like oxygen levels, PPE levels and decon order, need to come back instantly. Repetition makes recall automatic.

## Pair it with the course

Flashcards help with facts. The course gives you the context: why the numbers are what they are. See [[587]].`,

      body: `## Use it at the tailgate

Answer the supervisor's questions out loud. Ask your own.

## Review before new tasks

Before a PPE upgrade, review the PPE cards and module ([[585]]). Before monitoring work, review instruments ([[583]]).

## Read your site plan

Each site's plan is a refresher in itself: hazards, action levels, zones and emergency procedures.

## Flashcards once a month

Ten minutes with the deck keeps the core facts fresh.

## Take your refresher on time

The annual 8-hour refresher ([[595]]) is required, and it's also the best way to catch up on changes.
