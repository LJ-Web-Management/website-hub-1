      description: "What it takes to set up an ERT that meets HAZWOPER (q) and actually works at 2 a.m.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [702, 593],
      body: `An in-plant emergency response team (ERT) can stop a small release from becoming a big one. It's also a commitment: once your people respond, HAZWOPER (q) applies.

## Step 1: decide the scope

Write down what the ERT will and won't do. Many plants keep their ERT at the **operations level**: defensive actions from a safe distance, such as closing remote valves, diking and protecting drains, while leaving offensive work to the fire department or a hazmat contractor.

## Step 2: write the emergency response plan

Under 1910.120(q)(2) the plan covers pre-emergency planning, roles and lines of authority, training and communication, recognition and prevention, safe distances and places of refuge, site security, evacuation routes, decon, emergency medical treatment, alerting procedures and critique.

## Step 3: staff every shift

An ERT that only exists on day shift isn't an ERT. Aim for enough trained members on every shift to cover the roles.

## Step 4: train to the level

| Role | Training |
|---|---|
| All employees | Awareness: [[1099]] |
| ERT members (operations level) | [[702]], at least 8 hours or demonstrated competency |
| Shift supervisors and ERT captains | [[593]] |
| Members who'll approach the release (technician level) | 24 hours plus competencies |

## Step 5: equip and drill

PPE matched to your chemicals, monitors, spill supplies and radios. Then drill at least annually and critique each one.

## Step 6: medical surveillance

HAZMAT team members need medical surveillance under 1910.120(f). Plan for it from day one.`,

      title: "HAZWOPER, HazCom, RCRA or SPCC? A training map for plants",
      description: "Plants answer to several overlapping training rules. Here's how they fit together.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1099, 601, 416],
      body: `A typical manufacturing plant juggles several training requirements that sound alike. Here's what each covers.

## The map

| Rule | Covers | Who |
|---|---|---|
| Hazard Communication (1910.1200) | Chemical hazards at work, labels and SDSs | Every employee exposed to hazardous chemicals |
| HAZWOPER (q) (1910.120(q)) | Emergency response to releases | Anyone expected to respond; awareness for those who may discover a release |
| Emergency Action Plan (1910.38) | Evacuation and alarms | Every employee |
| RCRA generator training (40 CFR 262) | Hazardous waste handling | Hazardous waste personnel |
| SPCC (40 CFR 112.7(f)) | Oil spill prevention | Oil-handling personnel |
| DOT hazmat (49 CFR 172.704) | Shipping hazmat | Anyone who prepares or signs hazmat shipments |

## The common gap

Plants usually do HazCom and evacuation well. The gaps tend to be:

- Operators who are informally expected to "deal with" leaks but have no (q) training
- Waste handlers without documented RCRA training
- The person who signs waste manifests without DOT training

## A practical bundle

- **Everyone:** HazCom, the emergency action plan and [[1099]]
- **Waste handlers:** [[601]]
- **Oil handlers:** [[416]]
- **ERT and shift leads:** [[702]] and [[593]]`,

      title: "Running a chemical spill drill at your plant",
      description: "A drill that tests your plan, not just your stopwatch. How to plan, run and critique one.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [702, 593],
      body: `A drill is the only way to find out whether your emergency response plan works before you need it.

## Plan

1. **Pick a realistic scenario.** Use a chemical you actually have, in a place it could actually spill, on a shift that's actually short-staffed.
2. **Set objectives.** For example: alarm raised within 2 minutes, area isolated within 5, incident command set up within 10, drains protected within 15.
3. **Assign evaluators** who don't play in the drill.
4. **Tell the fire department** if they'll participate, or if they might hear about it.

## Run

- Start with the discovery: someone "finds" the spill.
- Let it play out. Don't coach unless there's a real safety issue.
- Evaluators log times, decisions and problems.

## What usually goes wrong

| Problem | Typical cause |
|---|---|
| Slow alarm | People aren't sure who to call |
| Responders too close | No one set an isolation distance |
| No clear incident commander | Shift lead didn't take command |
| Drain not protected | Drain covers stored far away |
| Missing SDS | Binder outdated or no electronic access |

## Critique

Hold a short debrief right after, while it's fresh, and a written critique within a week. Assign each fix to a person with a date. 1910.120(q)(2)(xi) lists critique of response and follow-up as part of the plan.
