      body: `EPA's **e-Manifest** system tracks hazardous waste shipments electronically. Receiving facilities submit every manifest to it, whether the manifest was electronic or paper.

## What generators need

- A **RCRAInfo** account for each site, with someone able to sign electronically if you use electronic manifests
- Access to view your site's manifests and final copies

## Paper or electronic

You can still use paper (with the receiving facility uploading it), a hybrid where the generator signs on paper, or fully electronic manifests. Check what your transporter and facility support.

## Watch for

- Final signed copies: check them in e-Manifest instead of waiting for paper in the mail
- Corrections the facility makes after receipt
- Exception reporting if the facility doesn't confirm receipt in time

See [[601]] for the rest of the generator rules.`,
