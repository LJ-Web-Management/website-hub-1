      courses: [584],
      body: `Decontamination follows one principle: **move from dirtiest to cleanest, and never let a clean surface touch a dirty one.**

## Station by station

1. **Equipment drop** first, so hands are free and tools stay in the warm zone.
2. **Wash and rinse outer boots and gloves**, the dirtiest surfaces, before anything else is touched.
3. **Tape removal**, now that the gloves are clean enough to handle it.
4. **Outer boots and gloves off.**
5. **Suit off**, rolled outward and down so the contaminated outside stays inside.
6. **SCBA off.** The respirator stays on until the suit is off, so you're protected while contamination is most likely to become airborne.
7. **Inner gloves off last**, so clean hands never touch dirty gear.
8. **Field wash** of hands and face before the support zone.

## Common errors

- Removing the respirator before the suit
- Touching the face during doffing
- Pulling the suit over the head
- Skipping the rinse because the line is busy

Exact lines vary with the site, contaminant and PPE level. Follow your site's decon plan.

      body: `Decon techs work in the warm zone, handling contaminated gear for hours. They need as much planning as the entry team.

## Staffing

- Enough techs to staff each station, plus relief
- A decon leader who controls the flow and watches for errors
- Rotation to manage heat and fatigue

## PPE

Usually one level below the entry team, set by the site plan, with chemical-resistant gloves and boots at minimum.

## Supplies

Pools, brushes, sprayers, decon solution, bags and drums for waste, chairs or stools for doffing, and a clean area for spare PPE.

## Emergency decon

Have a plan for an injured or collapsed entrant: rapid gross decon, cut-away suit removal and handoff to medical care. Practice it.

## Decon waste

Rinse water, used PPE and brushes are contaminated. Contain and manage them as the site plan requires.
