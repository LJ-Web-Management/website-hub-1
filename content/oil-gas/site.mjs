      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [591, 1056],
      body: `Crude oil and produced water spills look like a mess to clean up. The real risk is in the air.

## Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)

H2S comes with sour crude and produced water and collects in low spots: cellars, pits, tank hatches and ditches.

- It smells like rotten eggs at low levels, but **deadens your sense of smell** at higher levels. Never rely on your nose.
- It's heavier than air.
- At high concentrations a single breath can knock a person down.

**Controls:** personal H2S monitors on every worker, area monitors at known sources, wind socks, upwind approach and a rescue plan. Never enter a low spot after someone goes down without SCBA.

## Benzene

Benzene is part of crude and condensate. It's a known human carcinogen with an OSHA PEL of 1 ppm (8-hour TWA) under 29 CFR 1910.1028.

- Exposure is highest when oil is fresh, hot or agitated.
- A PID can screen for total hydrocarbon vapors, and benzene-specific tubes or sampling confirm.

## LEL

Fresh spills can create flammable atmospheres. Keep ignition sources out until the LEL reading is confirmed safe, often below 10% LEL as a work limit.

## The monitoring order

1. Oxygen
2. Flammability (LEL)
3. Toxics (H2S, then benzene via PID or tubes)

      title: "Does HAZWOPER apply in the oilfield?",
      description: "Routine production work usually isn't HAZWOPER. Spill cleanup and emergency response often are.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [591, 416],
      body: `Ask ten oilfield safety managers whether HAZWOPER applies and you'll get several answers. Here's the practical way to think about it.

## Usually not HAZWOPER

- Normal production, drilling and well servicing
- Incidental spills that the crew on site can clean up with normal equipment and no significant hazard

These are covered by other OSHA rules, such as hazard communication, PPE and respiratory protection.

## Often HAZWOPER

- **Emergency response** to a release that's beyond incidental, for example a large tank or line failure, H2S release or fire (1910.120(q))
- **Cleanup of a spill** when it's directed by a government agency, as with state-ordered remediation
- **Contractors whose business is spill cleanup**, often required by the operator's contract

## Operators often require it anyway

Many operators require 40-hour HAZWOPER for spill-response contractors and 24-hour or awareness training for their own field staff, whatever the exact regulatory trigger. Check your MSA.

## A practical setup

| Role | Training |
|---|---|
| Lease operators and pumpers | [[416]] and gas detection |
| In-house spill response team | [[591]] plus refresher |
| Spill cleanup contractors | [[591]] plus refresher |
| Midstream emergency responders | [[592]] |`,

      title: "Produced water spills: why they're harder than oil",
      description: "Saltwater spills kill vegetation, sterilize soil and travel fast. Response has to be quick and thorough.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [416, 478, 591],
      body: `Produced water, the brine that comes up with oil and gas, is often treated as less serious than a crude spill. It isn't.

## Why produced water is different

- **It moves fast.** Brine soaks in and runs off faster than oil.
- **It sterilizes soil.** High chloride levels kill vegetation and can leave a bare scar for years.
- **It doesn't float.** Booms won't catch it on water. It mixes in.
- **It may carry oil, H2S and NORM** (naturally occurring radioactive material), depending on the formation.

## First response

1. Stop the source: shut in the well, close the valve or kill the pump.
2. Check the air if the water is sour (H2S).
3. Contain with earthen berms or dikes ahead of the flow, and block culverts and ditches.
4. Recover free liquid with a vacuum truck.
5. Report it. Most producing states have reporting thresholds for produced water releases, often lower than for oil.

## Cleanup

Saltwater-impacted soil usually needs excavation or treatment. Sample to define the extent, and follow your state agency's cleanup guidance.

## Booms

Booms help with any oil sheen on top, but they won't contain the brine itself. For water, the answer is earthen containment and fast recovery.
