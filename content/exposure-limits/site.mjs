      courses: [583, 1056],
      body: `Exposure limits are averaged over time, usually 8 hours. A monitor reads right now. Action levels bridge the two.

## How sites set them

1. **Identify the contaminants of concern** from site characterization.
2. **Pick the most protective limit**: often the lowest of the OSHA PEL, the NIOSH REL and the ACGIH TLV.
3. **Set an action level below it**, often half the limit, so crews act before an exposure limit is reached.
4. **Translate to the instrument.** A PID reads total VOCs, so the action level is set on PID units, with a safety margin for the most toxic compound present.
5. **Define the response**: more monitoring, PPE upgrade, engineering controls or stop work.

## Example

Benzene's PEL is 1 ppm, and its action level under the benzene standard is 0.5 ppm. A site with gasoline contamination might set a PID action level that triggers benzene-specific monitoring, and stop work or upgrade to respirators if benzene approaches 0.5 ppm in the breathing zone.

## Your job

Know the numbers for today's task, watch the monitor and act on the plan, not on smell.

      body: `Smell is a poor warning system for chemical exposure.

## Olfactory fatigue

**Hydrogen sulfide** smells like rotten eggs at very low levels, but at higher concentrations it deadens your sense of smell. Workers have walked into fatal concentrations because "the smell went away."

## No smell at all

**Carbon monoxide** and low oxygen have no smell. **Carbon dioxide** has no smell at typical concentrations and collects in low areas.

## Smell only after the limit

Some chemicals can only be smelled at or above their exposure limit, so by the time you notice, you're already overexposed.

## What to do instead

- Carry a calibrated multi-gas monitor, and bump test it daily
- Use PIDs and chemical-specific tubes for vapors
- Follow the action levels in your site plan
- Leave immediately when an alarm sounds
