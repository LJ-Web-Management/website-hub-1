      body: `HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120) covers three kinds of work, each with its own training rules.

## 1. Cleanup sites, paragraph (e)

Hazardous waste site cleanups. Training depends on exposure:

| Exposure | Training |
|---|---|
| May be exposed at or above PELs, or need a respirator | [[587]] + 3 field days |
| Occasional, limited task, or monitored low-exposure areas | [[581]] + 1 field day |
| Supervising | Add 8 hours of supervisor training |

## 2. TSD facilities, paragraph (p)

Permitted treatment, storage and disposal facilities: 24 hours initial, 8 hours annually.

## 3. Emergency response, paragraph (q)

Training by role, from awareness ([[1099]]) through operations, technician, specialist and incident commander.

## Everyone renews

All of these come with annual refresher training.

## Not HAZWOPER, but related

Businesses that generate hazardous waste have EPA training rules (40 CFR 262), and shippers have DOT hazmat training (49 CFR 172.704). The finder covers these too.`,

      title: "When in doubt, why most employers choose the 40-hour",
      description: "The 24-hour is narrower than people think. Why the 40-hour is usually the safer choice.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [587, 581],
      body: `The 24-hour is allowed only for workers whose exposure really is limited. In practice, many employers default to the 40-hour. Here's why.

## Conditions change

A site that's characterized as low-exposure today can turn up a drum or a hot spot tomorrow. Workers with only 24 hours can't step into those tasks.

## Respirators

Anyone who needs a respirator is outside the 24-hour categories.

## Portability

Many employers and site owners require the 40-hour for all site personnel. A 40-hour certificate opens more doors for a worker.

## The cost difference is small

The difference between [[581]] and [[587]] is 16 hours and two field days. Compared with being sent off a job because training doesn't fit the task, it's a small investment.

## When the 24-hour makes sense

Surveyors, inspectors, delivery drivers and workers who stay in monitored, characterized areas. If that's clearly your role, the 24-hour is the right fit.
