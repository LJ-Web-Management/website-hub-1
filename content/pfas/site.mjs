      courses: [590, 586],
      body: `PFAS are measured at parts-per-trillion levels, and many everyday products contain them. Sampling crews follow strict precautions so their own gear doesn't contaminate samples.

## Commonly avoided on sampling days

- Waterproof or stain-resistant clothing and boots (unless verified PFAS-free)
- Tyvek-type suits not verified as PFAS-free
- PTFE (Teflon) tubing, tape and sampling equipment
- Waterproof field books and some sticky notes
- Some sunscreens, insect repellents and cosmetics
- Fast food wrappers and pre-packaged food in the sampling area

## Instead

- Laboratory-approved materials (HDPE, polypropylene, silicone)
- Nitrile gloves, changed often
- PFAS-free water for decon and blanks
- Field blanks and equipment blanks to catch contamination

Follow your project's sampling plan and the lab's guidance. Safety still comes first: if PPE is needed for hazards, wear it and document it.

      description: "Firefighting foam sites bring more than PFAS.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [590, 584],
      body: `Sites where aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) was used, such as airports, military bases, fire training areas and refineries, often have other hazards too.

## What crews may find

- **Fuels and solvents** from fire training pits
- **Heavy metals** and combustion residues
- **Utilities**: buried fuel lines and electrical lines at airfields and bases
- **Unexploded ordnance** on some military sites (requires specialist clearance)
- **Active operations**: aircraft and vehicle traffic

## Regulatory context

EPA designated PFOA and PFOS as CERCLA hazardous substances in 2024, and many states have their own PFAS standards. Expect more PFAS investigation and cleanup work, and site-specific health and safety plans that address PFAS along with other contaminants.

## Protect crews

HAZWOPER training, site-specific briefings, PPE based on the hazards, and thorough decon ([[584]]).`,
