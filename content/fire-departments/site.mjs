      description: "OSHA's responder levels, applied to a fire department roster.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1099, 589, 593],
      body: `Fire departments are emergency responders under HAZWOPER paragraph (q). In state-plan states the state rule applies to public employees. In federal OSHA states, EPA's 40 CFR Part 311 applies the same requirements to public employees. Volunteer coverage depends on the state.

Many departments also train to NFPA's hazmat competency standard (now NFPA 470), which lines up with OSHA's levels.

## Matching levels to roles

| Role | OSHA level | Course |
|---|---|---|
| Every member | Awareness, and usually operations | [[1099]] |
| Engine and truck companies | Operations: defensive actions, isolation, decon support | Department operations training |
| Hazmat team | Technician | [[589]] plus team training |
| Company officers and chiefs | Incident commander | [[593]] |

## Operations level

OSHA requires at least 8 hours of training, or demonstrated competency, for first responders at the operations level. Most departments deliver it in-house with hands-on drills.

## Annual refresher

Responders need annual refresher training, or a documented demonstration of competency, under (q)(8). See [[574]].

      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [584, 589],
      body: `Every hazmat incident needs a decon plan before anyone enters the hot zone.

## Gross decon

The fast first step: removing most contamination, usually by flushing with water and removing outer clothing. It's used for emergency decon of injured or exposed people and as the first station on a full line.

## Technical decon

A planned, multi-station line for entry teams in chemical protective clothing. Stations typically include equipment drop, wash, rinse, suit removal, SCBA removal and a final wash. The order keeps contamination moving away from the clean side.

## Mass decon

For large numbers of exposed civilians. Engines are often parked to form a corridor with fog streams (a ladder pipe or hose lines) so people can walk through, remove clothing and rinse. Speed matters more than perfection.

## Decon team safety

The decon team works in the warm zone and needs PPE, usually one level below the entry team, plus its own decon before leaving.

## Plan it before entry

Under HAZWOPER, the decon procedures must be in place before entry. No entry without a decon line ready.

## Mix and match

| Method | Good for |
|---|---|
| Online refresher | Regulations, chemistry, ICS review. Done on shift between calls |
| Company drills | PPE donning, decon setup, meter use |
| Multi-company exercises | Command, hazmat branch, mass decon |
| Post-incident critiques | Real lessons from real calls |

## A sample year

- **Quarter 1:** online refresher such as [[574]]
- **Quarter 2:** meter and detection drills, see [[1056]]
- **Quarter 3:** decon drill
- **Quarter 4:** tabletop or full-scale exercise with mutual aid

## Document it

For each member: date, topic, hours or competency demonstrated, and instructor. When OSHA, the state or your insurer asks, records are the proof.`,
