      body: `## 1. Approach safely

From upwind and uphill. Look for dead vegetation, frost on the ground, hissing, bubbling water, a sheen or a vapor cloud.

## 2. Protect people

Call 911. Keep people out, and evacuate or shelter as needed. Treat any gas release as flammable until monitoring says otherwise.

## 3. Control ignition sources

No vehicles, phones, tools or switches near the release. Don't operate electrical equipment in the area.

## 4. Monitor

Measure oxygen, %LEL and toxics (such as H₂S) from the edge inward. See [[1056]].

## 5. Isolate

Close valves only if you're trained and authorized and it's safe. Coordinate with the control room.

## 6. Hand over

Share what you know with the fire department and unified command: product, pressure, valve locations, and actions taken.

## The operator brings

- Product, pressure and line details
- Valve locations and shut-off times
- Specialized repair crews and equipment
- Knowledge of the right-of-way

## The fire department brings

- Scene control, rescue and fire suppression
- Evacuation and public protection
- Command of mutual aid resources

## Before the incident

Meet local departments, share maps and emergency contacts, and run joint exercises. Incident command training ([[593]]) helps your supervisors fit into the command structure.`,
