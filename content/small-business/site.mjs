      body: `Lots of small businesses generate hazardous waste without realizing it: auto shops, dry cleaners, print shops, salons, dental offices, labs, painters, photo studios and small manufacturers.

## Step 1: is it hazardous waste?

A waste is hazardous if it's on one of EPA's lists, or if it's:

- **Ignitable**, like solvents, thinners and some paints
- **Corrosive**, like strong acids and caustics
- **Reactive**
- **Toxic**, containing certain metals or chemicals above set limits

Check the safety data sheet, ask your supplier or a waste vendor.

## Step 2: how much per month?

| Category | Per month |
|---|---|
| Very small quantity generator (VSQG) | 100 kg (about 220 lb, roughly half a drum) or less |
| Small quantity generator (SQG) | More than 100 kg, less than 1,000 kg |
| Large quantity generator (LQG) | 1,000 kg or more |

## Step 3: know your rules

**VSQGs** (federal rules) must:

- Identify their hazardous waste
- Not accumulate more than 1,000 kg at any time
- Send waste to a facility allowed to receive it, which can include a household hazardous waste program that accepts VSQG waste if your state allows

**SQGs** have more: an EPA ID number, time limits, labels, inspections, an emergency coordinator, manifests and trained staff.

## Your state may be stricter

Many states add requirements, especially for VSQGs. Call your state environmental agency's small business assistance program. It's free.

- ☐ Count how much hazardous waste we made this month

## Every container

- ☐ Lid closed (no funnels left in)
- ☐ Not leaking, rusted or bulging
- ☐ Stored away from drains
- ☐ Incompatible wastes kept apart

## Universal waste

- ☐ Batteries, bulbs and aerosol cans in labeled boxes
- ☐ Dated, and shipped within a year

## Emergencies

- ☐ Spill kit stocked and easy to reach
- ☐ Fire extinguisher checked
- ☐ Emergency phone numbers posted
- ☐ Staff know who to call

## Records

      courses: [580, 601],
      body: `Under RCRA, generators are responsible for their hazardous waste "from cradle to grave." If a vendor mishandles it, the generator can still be on the hook.

## Questions to ask

1. **Do you have an EPA ID number and the permits required to haul and handle my waste?**
2. **Where does my waste go?** Get the name of the receiving facility.
3. **Will I get a signed copy of the manifest back** from the receiving facility?
4. **Can you help me profile my waste** and identify it correctly?
5. **What's included in the price?** Containers, labels, paperwork and transport.
6. **What insurance do you carry?**
7. **Can you provide references** from businesses like mine?

## Red flags

- Prices far below everyone else's
- Vague answers about where the waste goes
- No manifest, or a manifest you're asked to sign blank
- Cash-only, no written agreement

## After pickup

Keep your copy of the manifest and check that the final signed copy comes back. If it doesn't, follow up. See [[580]].`,
