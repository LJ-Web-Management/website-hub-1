Five to ten minutes. People stop listening after that, especially standing in PPE.

## Make it about today

Connect the topic to today's tasks, today's weather and today's hazards. "Drum handling" means more when there are drums to move this morning.

## Ask, don't lecture

Ask a question and wait for an answer. Let the crew share near misses and ideas.

## Cover the essentials every day

- Today's tasks and who's doing them
- PPE levels and any changes
- Weather and wind direction
- Emergency signals and muster point

## Write it down

Record the topic, date and attendees. It's evidence of training and shows the crew it matters.

4. **Ask the crew** where else it could happen

Near misses from your own site stick far better than generic topics. The annual refresher ([[595]]) is a good place to share the year's best lessons.`,
