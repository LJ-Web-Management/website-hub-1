      body: `OSHA considers the staffing agency and the host employer **joint employers** of temporary workers. Both are responsible for their safety.

## Typically, the staffing agency

- Asks about the hazards and tasks before placement
- Makes sure workers have the general training they need (such as the HAZWOPER course)
- Keeps training records and certificates
- Checks in on workers and the worksite

## Typically, the host employer

- Provides site-specific training and supervised field experience
- Provides PPE, medical surveillance and site safety plans as required
- Supervises day-to-day work and controls hazards

## Put it in writing

Spell out who provides which training, PPE and medical surveillance in the contract. Don't assume the other side has it covered.

      body: `1. **Confirm the course** with the host: 40-hour, 24-hour or a refresher?
2. **Buy seats in bulk** and enroll workers the same day
3. **Set a finish date**: 40 hours online usually takes a week of steady work
4. **Collect certificates** as each worker finishes
5. **Check refresher dates** for workers already certified ([[595]])
6. **Send the host a roster** with names, course, completion date and certificate copies
7. **Plan the field days**: the host provides supervised field experience on site
