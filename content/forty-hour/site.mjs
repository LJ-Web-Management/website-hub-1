      title: "40-hour or 24-hour HAZWOPER: which one does your job need?",
      description: "OSHA ties the hours to your exposure, not your job title. Here's how to tell which initial course applies.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [587, 588],
      body: `OSHA's HAZWOPER standard doesn't say "laborers need 40 hours." It ties the training to how much exposure you could have. That's why two people on the same site can need different courses.

## The rule in one table

| Who | Initial training | Field experience | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| General site workers who may be exposed at or above the PEL | 40 hours | 3 days, supervised | 1910.120(e)(3)(i) |
| Workers on site only occasionally for a limited task | 24 hours | 1 day, supervised | 1910.120(e)(3)(ii) |
| Workers regularly on site in areas monitored below the PEL, no respirator needed | 24 hours | 1 day, supervised | 1910.120(e)(3)(iii) |
| Supervisors and managers of site work | 40 or 24 hours, plus 8 hours of supervisor training | Same as their crew | 1910.120(e)(4) |

## Ask three questions

1. **Could I be exposed at or above a permissible exposure limit?** If yes, or if nobody knows yet, it's the 40-hour.
2. **Will I need a respirator?** Respirator use almost always means 40 hours.
3. **Am I there every day, or once in a while for one task?** A surveyor who walks the site twice is the textbook 24-hour worker. The excavator operator in the hot zone all week isn't.

> When the site isn't characterized yet, assume the 40-hour. Exposure is unknown, and OSHA expects you to plan for the worst until monitoring says otherwise.

## Moving up from 24 to 40

If you took the 24-hour and your job changes, you don't start over. Under 1910.120(e)(3)(iv), a 24-hour worker who becomes a general site worker needs **16 more hours** of training and two more days of field experience. Many employers simply enroll the worker in the full 40-hour, which also gives a clean single certificate.

## After either one

Both courses lead to the same annual 8-hour refresher. The clock starts on the date of your initial certificate.

## Which 40-hour?

Every 40-hour track on this site meets the same 40 hours of instruction. The difference is the examples. Pick the one that sounds like your workday: [[588]], [[590]], [[591]], [[592]] or [[589]]. If none fits, [[587]] covers everything.

      slug: "hazwoper-field-experience-three-days",
      title: "The three days of field experience: what online training can't do for you",
      description: "The 40-hour has two parts. The course covers the classroom part. Here's how employers handle the supervised days on site.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [587, 590],
      body: `Every honest 40-hour HAZWOPER provider should tell you this up front: the 40 hours of instruction are only half of the requirement. 29 CFR 1910.120(e)(3)(i) also requires **a minimum of three days of actual field experience under the direct supervision of a trained, experienced supervisor.**

An online course covers the 40 hours. Your employer provides the three days.

## What counts as field experience

OSHA doesn't publish a checklist, but the intent is clear. The new worker should do the real tasks of the site while someone qualified watches, corrects and signs off. Typical days include:

- Suiting up and doffing in the PPE level the site actually uses, including a respirator fit check
- Working the decon line, both as the person being decontaminated and as a decon tech
- Reading and using the site's air monitoring instruments
- Walking the site control zones and the emergency routes
- Doing normal tasks such as sampling, excavation support or drum handling with a supervisor alongside

## Who can supervise

A trained, experienced supervisor. In practice that means someone with their own 40-hour, the 8-hour supervisor course and real time on hazardous waste sites. That's often the site safety officer or a foreman.

## Writing it down

Keep a simple record for each worker: dates, site, tasks performed and the supervisor's signature. Put it with the course certificate. Together they make up the worker's initial HAZWOPER qualification under 1910.120(e)(6).

> Tip for contractors: build the field days into the first project a new hire works on. It's cheaper than a separate training event, and the experience is real.

## Can the field days be skipped?

Only through the equivalent-training route in 1910.120(e)(9). An employer can count documented prior experience and training as equivalent, but must be able to show it. A worker coming from another HAZWOPER site with records in hand is the usual case. "He's been around this stuff for years" without paperwork is not.

      title: "Construction, remediation, oil & gas, pipeline or hazmat: picking your 40-hour track",
      description: "All six 40-hour courses meet the same OSHA requirement. The track decides which examples, hazards and scenarios you'll study.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [588, 590, 591, 592, 589],
      body: `Every 40-hour course on this site meets the same OSHA requirement and prints the same kind of certificate. So why have six?

Because people remember training that looks like their job. A pipeline crew learns more from a line-strike scenario than from a drum-handling one, even when the underlying lesson about flammable atmospheres is identical.

## Quick picker

| If your crew mostly... | Take |
|---|---|
| Digs, grades or builds on contaminated ground | [[588]] |
| Samples, drills, excavates and hauls during a cleanup | [[590]] |
| Responds to crude, fuel or produced-water releases | [[591]] |
| Repairs gas, liquids or power lines when something leaks | [[592]] |
| Runs a fire or industrial hazmat team | [[589]] |
| Does a mix, or doesn't know yet | [[587]] |

## What's the same in every track

- Hazard recognition and toxicology
- The site safety and health plan
- PPE levels and respirators
- Air monitoring
- Decontamination
- Site control and emergency procedures

## What changes

The scenarios, the photos and the walk-throughs. A construction track spends more time on trenching through impacted soil. The oil & gas track spends more on benzene, H2S and LEL readings. The fire/hazmat track spends more on incident command and the hand-off from emergency response to cleanup.

## Mixed crews

If a contractor sends people to many kinds of jobs, the general [[587]] is the safest single choice. Use the industry tracks when a crew is dedicated to one kind of work.

## Will another employer accept it?

Yes. The certificate states the 40 hours under 1910.120(e). The industry name tells the next employer what you trained on, which usually helps.`,
