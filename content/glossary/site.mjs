      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [583, 587],
      body: `| Limit | Set by | Means | Legally binding? |
|---|---|---|---|
| PEL | OSHA | Permissible exposure limit, usually an 8-hour TWA | Yes |
| REL | NIOSH | Recommended exposure limit, often lower than the PEL | No, it's a recommendation |
| TLV | ACGIH | Threshold limit value, updated regularly | No, unless adopted by a rule |
| STEL | OSHA, NIOSH or ACGIH | 15-minute short-term limit | Yes when it's an OSHA STEL |
| Ceiling | OSHA, NIOSH or ACGIH | Never to be exceeded, even briefly | Yes when it's an OSHA ceiling |
| IDLH | NIOSH | Immediately dangerous to life or health | Used for respirator selection |

## Why there are so many

Many OSHA PELs date from the early 1970s and haven't been updated. NIOSH and ACGIH publish newer, often lower, values. California updates its own PELs more often than federal OSHA.

## What your site plan uses

Many site safety plans set action levels using the **lowest** of the PEL, REL and TLV, to stay protective. Your plan's action levels are the numbers to follow.

## IDLH and respirators

IDLH conditions require the most protective respirators: SCBA or supplied air with an escape bottle. Air-purifying respirators (Level C) aren't allowed in IDLH atmospheres.
