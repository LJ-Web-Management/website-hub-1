      title: "Do you qualify for the 24-hour HAZWOPER?",
      description: "Two narrow groups can take 24 hours instead of 40. Here's how to tell if you're in one.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [581],
      body: `The 40-hour is the default for hazardous waste site workers. The 24-hour is the exception, and it's narrower than many people think.

## The two groups

**1. Occasional workers with limited tasks** (1910.120(e)(3)(ii)). You're on site only occasionally, for a specific limited task such as groundwater monitoring, land surveying or a geophysical survey, and you're unlikely to be exposed over the permissible exposure limits.

**2. Regular workers in low-exposure areas** (1910.120(e)(3)(iii)). You're on site regularly, but only in areas that have been monitored and fully characterized, where exposures are below the limits and respirators aren't needed, and there are no health hazards or the possibility of an emergency developing.

## Quick test

| Question | 24-hour is possible if… |
|---|---|
| Will you need a respirator? | No |
| Has the work area been monitored and characterized? | Yes |
| Could you be exposed at or above a PEL? | No |
| Do you enter the exclusion zone for hands-on work? | No, or only occasionally for a limited task |

If any answer goes the wrong way, it's the 40-hour.

## Field experience

The 24-hour also requires **one day** of actual field experience under a trained, experienced supervisor. The online course covers the 24 hours of instruction, and your employer runs the field day.

> The 24-hour isn't a "lite" version of the 40-hour for busy people. It's for workers whose exposure really is limited. If that changes, so does your training.

      slug: "upgrading-from-24-to-40-hour",
      title: "Upgrading from the 24-hour to the 40-hour",
      description: "Your job changed and now you need the 40-hour. You don't have to start from zero.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [581, 595],
      body: `It happens all the time. A surveyor starts helping with sampling, or a driver starts working inside the exclusion zone. The 24-hour training no longer fits the job.

## What the rule allows

Under 29 CFR 1910.120(e)(3)(iv), a worker with 24 hours of training who becomes a general site worker, or who needs a respirator, needs:

- **16 more hours** of training, and
- **2 more days** of supervised field experience,

for a total of 40 hours and three days.

## In practice

Many employers just enroll the worker in the full 40-hour course. It's simpler to track, it gives one clean certificate that every future employer recognizes, and the review of the first 24 hours doesn't hurt. If you only take the extra 16 hours, keep both certificates together so the full 40 is clear.

## Your refresher date

Your annual 8-hour refresher keeps running from your most recent HAZWOPER training. Upgrading resets nothing except your certificate level.

## When to upgrade

- Before the first day you work in an area where exposure could exceed a PEL
- Before you're assigned a respirator
- Before you start hands-on work in the exclusion zone

Not after. The training has to come first.`,

      title: "What happens on the one-day field experience",
      description: "The 24-hour comes with a supervised day on site. Here's what a good one covers.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [581, 576],
      body: `The 24 hours of instruction can be done online. The field day can't. OSHA requires a minimum of one day of actual field experience under the direct supervision of a trained, experienced supervisor.

## A good field day covers

1. **The site tour.** Exclusion zone, contamination reduction zone and support zone, plus where the decon line is and where you muster in an emergency.
2. **The site safety plan.** What hazards are present, what the action levels are and who's in charge.
3. **Your PPE.** Put it on and take it off with the supervisor watching.
4. **Your task.** Do the real task you're there for, with the supervisor alongside.
5. **Decon.** Walk through decon as if you'd been in the exclusion zone.
6. **Emergency signals.** What the horn means and where to go.

## Who signs off

The supervising person, who should have their own HAZWOPER training plus supervisor training and real site time, records the date, site, tasks and their signature.

## Keep it with your certificate

Your 24-hour qualification is the course certificate plus the field day record. Keep both. A future employer or an inspector will want to see both.`,
