| Certificate | Why |
|---|---|
| [[403]] | DOT hazmat and RCRA basics |
| [[599]] | Technician skills employers look for |
| CDL with hazmat endorsement | Required to drive placarded loads |

## Later in your career

## Keep your records

Save every certificate as a PDF on your phone and in email. Note your refresher due date. When you apply, list each certificate with the date completed.

## A word of caution

Training gets you in the door. Employers still require their own site orientation, the supervised field days after the 40-hour, medical clearance and respirator fit testing before you work in the field.`,
