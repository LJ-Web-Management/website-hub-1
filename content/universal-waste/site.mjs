## Both

- **Time limit**: up to one year from when the waste was generated or received
- **Labels**: for example "Universal Waste—Batteries" or "Used Lamps"
- **Show the date**: on the container, an inventory, or another method
- **Contain releases** and manage broken items properly
- **Ship only** to another handler or a destination facility

Many states add their own categories, such as electronics, so check your state.

- Store in closed, structurally sound containers, such as the original boxes
- Don't tape tubes together or break them to save space
- Clean up broken lamps right away and keep the debris in a closed container

## Batteries

- Store in containers that are closed, compatible and in good condition
- **Tape terminals or bag batteries individually**, especially lithium batteries, to prevent short circuits and fires
- Keep damaged or swollen lithium batteries separate, in non-combustible containers
- Keep away from heat and ignition sources

## Everyone

Label the container and show the start date. Train staff where the containers are and what goes in them. See [[602]].`,
