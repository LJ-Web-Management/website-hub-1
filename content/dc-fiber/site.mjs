      body: `Contamination on connector end faces is one of the most common causes of fiber link problems. A speck of dust on a single-mode core is a big obstacle to light.

## The routine

1. **Inspect** both end faces with a fiber scope before every connection
2. **Clean** if anything is on them: dry clean first (click cleaner or lint-free wipe)
3. **Inspect again**. If still dirty, wet-dry clean and inspect again
4. **Connect** only when both ends pass

## Never

- Touch the end face
- Blow on it or use compressed air from a can
- Leave connectors or ports uncapped
- Look into a fiber or port: invisible laser light can damage your eyes

## Also clean the ports

Bulkhead ports in patch panels and transceivers need port-style cleaners.

      courses: [834, 829],
      body: `A **loss budget** estimates how much light the link will lose so you know before testing whether it should work.

## Add up

| Item | Typical allowance (check your standard and vendor specs) |
|---|---|
| Each mated connector pair | 0.75 dB max per TIA-568 (low-loss connectors are often much less) |
| Each splice | 0.3 dB max |
| Multimode fiber at 850 nm | about 3.0–3.5 dB per km |
| Single-mode fiber at 1310 nm | about 0.4–1.0 dB per km |

## Compare

The total must be below the maximum channel loss of the application, such as a particular Ethernet speed and optic. High-speed multimode links have very tight budgets, so every connector counts.

## Then test

Tier 1 testing with a light source and power meter measures total loss. Tier 2 adds an OTDR trace to locate events. Record results for every link.`,
