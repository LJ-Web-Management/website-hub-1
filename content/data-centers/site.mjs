      description: "Lead-acid and lithium-ion UPS batteries carry different risks. What facilities teams need to know.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1056, 479, 1099],
      body: `UPS battery rooms keep the data center running during power interruptions. They also store a lot of energy and chemicals.

## Lead-acid batteries (VRLA and flooded)

- **Hydrogen gas** is produced during charging, especially overcharging. Hydrogen is flammable above about 4% in air. Battery rooms need ventilation, and many have hydrogen detection.
- **Sulfuric acid electrolyte** can leak from damaged or flooded cells. Keep acid-neutralizing spill kits and eyewash stations nearby.
- **Thermal runaway** is possible with VRLA batteries in high temperatures.

## Lithium-ion batteries

- **Thermal runaway** can spread cell to cell, releasing flammable and toxic gases and causing fires that are hard to put out.
- Battery management systems, off-gas detection and specific fire protection are common.

## Everyday controls

- PPE for battery work: face shield, acid-resistant gloves and apron
- Insulated tools
- No ignition sources in the room
- Eyewash and spill kits within reach. OSHA requires suitable facilities for flushing eyes where corrosives are present.
- Follow the battery manufacturer's procedures

## If something goes wrong

Smoke, a sweet chemical smell, swelling or heat from a battery cabinet: get out, alert others and call the emergency number. See [[1099]].`,

      title: "Generator fuel and SPCC at data centers",
      description: "Backup generator fuel storage often triggers EPA's spill prevention rule. What that means.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [416, 479],
      body: `Most data centers keep diesel on site for backup generators, often tens of thousands of gallons across belly tanks, day tanks and bulk tanks.

## Does SPCC apply?

EPA's Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure rule (40 CFR Part 112) applies when a facility has more than **1,320 gallons** of aboveground oil storage (counting containers of 55 gallons or more) and could discharge to navigable waters or shorelines. Many data centers exceed that easily.

## What's required

- A written **SPCC plan**, certified by a professional engineer unless you qualify to self-certify
- **Secondary containment** for tanks and transfer areas
- **Inspections and testing** of tanks
- **Training** for oil-handling personnel and an **annual discharge prevention briefing**

## The riskiest moments

- **Fuel deliveries**: overfills, hose failures and drivers walking away
- **Generator testing**: leaks at fittings and day tanks
- **Fuel polishing and maintenance**

## Good practice

- Attend every delivery
- Keep oil spill kits at fill points and the generator yard
- Protect storm drains near fuel areas
- Train staff on the SPCC plan. See [[416]].`,

      courses: [1056, 601],
      body: `## Refrigerants

Chillers and CRAC units use refrigerants. A large leak in an enclosed space can displace oxygen. Some newer refrigerants are mildly flammable. Machine rooms often have refrigerant detectors and ventilation.

## Glycol cooling loops

Propylene or ethylene glycol mixtures circulate in cooling systems. Leaks are slippery and messy, and ethylene glycol is toxic if swallowed. Spent glycol must be managed properly, as it can't go down storm drains.

## Clean agent fire suppression

Systems using agents such as HFC-227ea or FK-5-1-12 flood the space when they discharge. They're designed to be safe for occupied spaces at design concentrations, but staff should still leave the area on alarm. After a discharge, ventilate and confirm normal oxygen before re-entry.

## Inert gas systems

Inergen and similar systems lower the oxygen level to stop a fire. Evacuate on alarm, and don't re-enter until the space has been ventilated and checked. See [[1056]].

## Waste

Spent coolant, filters and some cleaning chemicals can be hazardous waste. See [[601]].`,
