      body: `Most construction never touches HAZWOPER. Then a project lands on a former gas station, a closed landfill or a brownfield, and suddenly it does.

## When 1926.65 applies

29 CFR 1926.65 covers construction work that involves:

- Cleanup operations at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites required by a government body
- Corrective actions at RCRA sites
- Voluntary cleanup at sites recognized by a government body as uncontrolled hazardous waste sites
- Emergency response to releases of hazardous substances

In practice, if your project is part of a remediation or the contaminated material is being dug up, moved or managed, assume HAZWOPER applies to the crew doing that work.

## Red flags in bid documents

| Look for | What it usually means |
|---|---|
| "Environmental contractor" or "LSP/LEP oversight" | Contamination is known |
| "Soil management plan" or "materials management plan" | Impacted soil will be handled |
| "Health and safety plan required" | Site-specific HASP under HAZWOPER |
| "40-hour HAZWOPER required for all personnel in work zone" | Exactly what it says |

## Who needs what

- **Crew in the excavation or operating equipment in impacted areas:** [[588]]
- **Occasional visitors and staff in monitored, low-exposure areas:** [[581]]
- **Foremen and superintendents:** add [[597]]

> Get the training before mobilization. A crew that shows up without certificates sits on the sidelines while the environmental contractor works.`,

      title: "Excavating contaminated soil: what changes for the crew",
      description: "Digging impacted soil is still digging. But air, skin and decon now matter as much as trench protection.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [588, 585],
      body: `An excavation on a contaminated site has every hazard a normal trench has, plus chemical ones. The trench rules (1926 Subpart P) still apply in full.

## Air

Volatile contaminants such as fuels and solvents collect in trenches and low spots. Expect:

- Direct-reading monitoring at the excavation, often with a PID and a multi-gas meter
- Action levels in the site plan that trigger a PPE upgrade or a stop-work
- Oxygen and LEL checks before anyone enters a trench deeper than 4 feet where a hazardous atmosphere could exist

## Skin

Impacted soil and groundwater get on boots, gloves and equipment. Chemical-resistant boots and gloves are common, even at Level D.

## Dust

Dry, impacted soil becomes airborne contamination. Wet it down, limit drop heights and stop when monitors climb.

## Equipment

Machines that work in the exclusion zone get decontaminated before they leave, typically at a wash pad with containment. Tracks and buckets carry the most.

## Spoils

Contaminated spoils are waste, not fill. Stockpile them on liners, cover them and keep them separate from clean soil.

## Groundwater

Pumped water from an impacted excavation usually can't go to a storm drain. Follow the site plan for treatment or containment.

      title: "Working under the environmental contractor's health and safety plan",
      description: "On remediation-driven projects, the site plan often isn't yours. Here's how to work inside it.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [597, 588],
      body: `On many contaminated-site projects, an environmental consultant or remediation contractor writes the site health and safety plan (HASP) and controls the zones. Your construction crew works inside their system.

## Before mobilization

- Get the HASP and read it, especially hazards, action levels, PPE by task and emergency procedures.
- Confirm every worker has current training: the 40-hour or 24-hour, a refresher within 12 months, supervisor training for foremen, medical clearance and respirator fit tests if needed.
- Ask who has stop-work authority. Usually it's both companies' site leads.

## On site

- Attend the daily tailgate. The plan can change daily as monitoring data comes in.
- Follow the zone boundaries. Construction equipment doesn't cross into the support zone without decon.
- Report changes, such as new odors, staining, drums or buried debris, right away.

## Your responsibilities still apply

Your company still owns its own workers' safety under OSHA's multi-employer citation policy. Following the other company's HASP doesn't replace your own training, PPE program and supervision. That's what [[597]] covers.

## Common friction points

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Different PPE assumptions | Agree on PPE by task in writing before the job starts |
| Decon slows production | Plan the decon pad and traffic flow into the schedule |
| Unclear stop-work authority | Name it in the pre-job meeting |`,
