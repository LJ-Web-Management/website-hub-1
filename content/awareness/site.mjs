      description: "Awareness responders have one job, and it isn't cleaning up. A plain explanation.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1099],
      body: `OSHA's HAZWOPER standard sorts emergency responders into levels. **Awareness** is the first, and it has the most people.

## The job in three words

**Recognize. Isolate. Notify.**

That's it. Awareness-level responders:

1. **Recognize** that something hazardous has been released
2. **Isolate** the area by keeping people away and getting clear themselves
3. **Notify** the right people, such as supervisors, the emergency coordinator or 911

And then they **take no further action** to control the release.

## What awareness responders must understand

Under 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(6)(i), they must show they understand:

- What hazardous substances are, and the risks
- The potential outcomes of an emergency involving them
- How to recognize that hazardous substances are present
- How to identify them, if possible
- Their role in the employer's emergency response plan, including site security and control
- When and how to notify, and the need for more resources

## Who should be trained

Anyone likely to discover a release: security officers, warehouse staff, truck drivers, maintenance staff, front desk staff and custodians.

## What they don't do

No absorbing, no plugging, no moving drums, no going back in to "check." Those are jobs for operations-level and technician-level responders with more training and the right PPE.

      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1099, 479],
      body: `You're walking the warehouse and there's a puddle under a pallet of drums. Or a strange smell near the loading dock. Here's what to do.

## Do

1. **Stop.** Don't walk into it or touch it.
2. **Look from a distance.** Labels, placards or markings on the containers? Note what you see.
3. **Get away.** Move back, upwind and uphill if you can.
4. **Warn others.** Keep people from walking in.
5. **Call it in.** Use your site's emergency number or 911. Say what, where, how much and whether anyone is hurt.
6. **Stay at a safe distance** to meet responders and tell them what you saw.

## Don't

- Don't be a hero. Don't try to stop the leak.
- Don't touch, smell or taste anything to identify it.
- Don't walk through it, drive through it or let anyone else.
- Don't use your phone or radio right next to a flammable vapor release.
- Don't assume it's "just water."

## Small and known?

Some spills are incidental: a known material, a small amount and no real hazard, like a little motor oil. If you've been trained and your site allows it, you can clean those up with a spill kit. See [[479]]. If you're not sure, it's not incidental.

      description: "The diamond on the truck tells you more than you'd think. How to read it from a safe distance.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1099],
      body: `Trucks, rail cars and many containers carry DOT hazard placards. Awareness responders learn to read them, from a distance.

## The nine hazard classes

| Class | Hazard | Placard |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Explosives | Orange |
| 2 | Gases | Red (flammable), green (non-flammable), white (poison gas) |
| 3 | Flammable liquids | Red |
| 4 | Flammable solids, spontaneously combustible, dangerous when wet | Red/white stripes, red/white, blue |
| 5 | Oxidizers and organic peroxides | Yellow |
| 6 | Toxic and infectious substances | White |
| 7 | Radioactive | Yellow and white |
| 8 | Corrosives | Black and white |
| 9 | Miscellaneous | Black and white stripes |

## The four-digit number

Many placards or orange panels show a **UN/NA number**, such as 1203 for gasoline. That number is the key to the Emergency Response Guidebook.

## Using the ERG

The ERG is a free DOT book, also available as an app.

1. **Yellow pages:** look up the four-digit number to find a guide number.
2. **Blue pages:** look up the material by name if you don't have the number.
3. **Orange pages:** the guide tells you the hazards, public safety advice and initial isolation distance.
4. **Green pages:** for some materials, protective action distances for large spills.

## Use binoculars, not your feet

If you can't read it from a safe distance, back off and report what you can see. Responders will take it from there.`,
