## Cover every time

- **Open alarms** and what's been done about them
- **Work in progress**: active MOPs, permits, contractors on site
- **Equipment out of service** and the redundancy you've lost because of it
- **Abnormal configurations**: bypasses, manual overrides, temporary power
- **Scheduled work** for the coming shift
- **Customer or tenant issues** still open

## How to run it

1. Written log first, verbal walk-through second
2. Walk the floor together if something's abnormal
3. Incoming lead signs off that they've read and understood it

## Red flags

"Nothing to report" on a shift with work in progress. Handovers by text message. Leaving before the relief arrives.

## Three document types

| Document | Used for |
|---|---|
| **MOP** (method of procedure) | A specific planned change: step by step, with rollback |
| **SOP** (standard operating procedure) | Routine tasks done the same way every time |
| **EOP** (emergency operating procedure) | What to do when something fails |

## A good MOP includes

- Scope, risk level and the redundancy affected
- Approvals and the maintenance window
- Pre-checks, numbered steps, hold points and verification
- A rollback plan for every step that can go wrong
- Who does each step and who checks it

## Make it stick

Review MOPs before the window, rehearse high-risk ones, and debrief after. Feed lessons into the preventive maintenance plan ([[839]]).`,
