      courses: [599, 403],
      body: `A lab pack is many small containers of chemical waste packed into a larger outer container, usually a drum, with absorbent. They're common at labs, schools, hospitals and cleanouts.

## Before you pack

1. **Inventory every container.** Name, quantity, condition.
2. **Classify each item** by DOT hazard class and RCRA waste codes.
3. **Segregate** into compatible groups. Flammables, oxidizers, acids, bases, water-reactives and poisons each get their own pack.
4. **Set aside problem items:** unknowns, peroxide formers, shock-sensitive materials, leaking or bulging containers, compressed gases. These need special handling.

## Packing

- Use the outer packaging authorized for the hazard class, typically a UN-specification drum.
- Inner containers must be tightly closed and in good condition.
- Surround them with enough **compatible absorbent** to absorb the liquid contents. Don't use combustible absorbent with oxidizers.
- Keep inner containers upright and separated.
- Respect the weight and volume limits for the packaging and for the DOT lab pack provisions.

## Paperwork

- A **packing list** for each drum, inside and with the shipping papers
- Correct DOT description on the manifest
- Waste codes and LDR information

## Never

- Mix incompatibles in one pack "because there's room"
- Pack an unknown without identifying it
- Open a container to check what's in it unless that's your trained task and procedure

      description: "Bulking drums saves money. Mixing the wrong two saves nothing. How techs check compatibility.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [599],
      body: `Consolidating, or bulking, combines compatible wastes into larger containers to cut disposal costs. It's routine work, and it's where many waste-industry incidents start.

## Classic bad combinations

| Mix | What can happen |
|---|---|
| Acids + cyanides or sulfides | Toxic gas (HCN, H2S) |
| Acids + bases (concentrated) | Violent heat and splattering |
| Oxidizers + flammables or organics | Fire or explosion |
| Water-reactives + aqueous wastes | Heat, flammable gas, fire |
| Bleach + ammonia | Toxic chloramine gas |
| Bleach + acids | Chlorine gas |

## Before consolidating

1. **Know both wastes.** Approved profiles, not guesses.
2. **Check compatibility** with a chart such as the EPA chemical compatibility chart, and your company's procedures.
3. **Do a bench test** when your procedure calls for it: a small, controlled mix with monitoring for heat, gas and reaction.
4. **Ground and bond** containers when transferring flammable liquids.
5. **Monitor the air** during transfer, and have the right PPE and ventilation.

## During

- Pour slowly and watch for heat, fuming, bubbling or color change.
- Stop at the first sign of reaction and back away.

## After

Label the receiving container with the combined contents, update the profile if needed, and record what was consolidated, when and by whom.

      body: `Environmental services companies hire people with all kinds of backgrounds. The training path tends to look the same.

## Year one

| Training | Why |
|---|---|
| 40-hour HAZWOPER | Field work on customer sites and cleanups |
| [[403]] | You'll be packaging, marking and loading hazmat within weeks |
| [[599]] | The technician skills: lab packs, consolidation, profiles |
| Respirator fit test and medical clearance | Before respirator use |

If you'll also work at the company's permitted facility, add [[582]].

## Every year

- 8-hour HAZWOPER refresher, and [[594]] if you work at the TSDF
- Respirator fit test
- Medical surveillance exam, if you're covered

## Every three years

- DOT hazmat refresher

## Moving up to lead tech

- 8-hour HAZWOPER supervisor training
- [[580]] if you'll prepare manifests for customers
- Incident command if you'll lead emergency response jobs

## Keep your own copies

Your certificates are your résumé in this industry. Keep copies on your phone and in a folder. When you change companies, the right paperwork can save you weeks of retraining.`,
