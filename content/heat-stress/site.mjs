Impermeable PPE can make real heat stress far worse than the index shows, so use physiological monitoring and your site's heat plan.</p>

      body: `Your body cools mostly by sweating. Impermeable suits stop sweat from evaporating, so heat builds up quickly, even on a mild day.

## Signs to watch

| Condition | Signs | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Heat rash, cramps | Muscle spasms, red bumps | Rest, water, cool place |
| Heat exhaustion | Heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, headache | Remove from heat, remove PPE after decon, cool down, fluids, get medical help if not improving |
| Heat stroke | Confusion, slurred speech, hot skin, collapse, seizures | **Emergency: call 911**, cool the worker immediately |

## Controls

- **Acclimatize** new and returning workers gradually
- **Work/rest cycles** based on heat, workload and PPE level
- **Cooling vests** and shaded, cool rest areas
- **Hydration**: small amounts often
- **Physiological monitoring**: heart rate and body temperature as your site plan specifies
- **Buddy system** to spot early signs
