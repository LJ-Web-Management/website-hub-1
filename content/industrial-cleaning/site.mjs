      description: "Not every cleaning job is a hazardous waste operation. The ones that are, and why clients often require the 40-hour anyway.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [587],
      body: `## Often HAZWOPER

- Removing **hazardous waste** such as sludges, residues and tank bottoms that are hazardous waste
- Cleaning at a **TSDF** (paragraph (p)) or on a **cleanup site**
- **Emergency response** to spills and releases
- Post-emergency **cleanup** after a release

## Usually not HAZWOPER

- Routine cleaning of non-hazardous materials
- Production cleaning where the material is product, not waste. Other OSHA standards still apply, especially confined spaces, respiratory protection and hazard communication.

## Why clients require it anyway

Refineries, chemical plants and utilities often require 40-hour HAZWOPER for all cleaning contractors, because:

- Cleaning scopes change mid-job
- Waste determinations happen after material is removed
- One training standard is easier for site access

## Training stack for cleaning crews

| Training | Why |
|---|---|
| [[587]] and annual [[595]] | Client requirement and HAZWOPER scopes |
| [[1056]] | Tanks, pits and confined spaces |
| Confined space entry training | Required for permit spaces (1910.146) |
| Respiratory protection | Fit test and medical clearance |`,

      description: "Vac trucks pull vapors as well as liquids. The hazards and controls operators need to know.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1056, 416],
      body: `A vacuum truck pulls air along with liquid and sludge, and that air has to go somewhere. The exhaust can carry flammable or toxic vapors to wherever the truck is parked.

## The main hazards

- **Flammable vapors** at the exhaust and around the hose connection
- **Toxic vapors** such as H2S and benzene from the material being collected
- **Static electricity** from flowing liquids and hoses
- **Hose failures** and spills
- **Incompatible materials** mixing in the tank

## Controls

1. **Know what you're collecting.** Get the SDS or profile before you start, and don't mix incompatible loads.
2. **Bond and ground** the truck, the hose and the source container for flammable liquids.
3. **Vent exhaust safely**, away from ignition sources and people. Use a vent hose or carbon filtration where required.
4. **Monitor** at the exhaust and the work area with a multi-gas meter and PID.
5. **Inspect hoses and fittings** before each job.
6. **Position the truck upwind** where possible, and out of low spots.

## Spills

Keep a spill kit on the truck and know how to stop a hose leak. See [[416]].

      description: "Tank entry kills more cleaning workers than any chemical. The essentials of entering safely.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1056, 587],
      body: `Tanks, vessels, pits and sumps are confined spaces, and most that need cleaning are **permit-required confined spaces** under 29 CFR 1910.146.

## Why tanks are deadly

- Oxygen can be displaced by nitrogen purges or consumed by rust
- Residues give off flammable or toxic vapors, and more when disturbed
- Engulfment in sludge or product
- Mechanical and electrical hazards from mixers and pumps

## Before entry

1. **Permit** completed and signed by the entry supervisor
2. **Isolation**: blind or disconnect lines, lock out mixers and pumps
3. **Clean and ventilate** from outside as much as possible
4. **Test the atmosphere**: oxygen first, then LEL, then toxics, from the top to the bottom of the space
5. **Attendant** stationed outside, with a means of communication
6. **Rescue plan** ready, with retrieval equipment where practical

## During entry

Monitor continuously. Cleaning stirs up residues, and readings can change fast. If an alarm sounds, everyone gets out.

## Never

- Enter to rescue without SCBA and a plan. Many confined space deaths are would-be rescuers.
