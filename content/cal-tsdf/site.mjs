      body: `California TSDF workers fall under two sets of rules.

## Cal/OSHA (worker safety)

Title 8 §5192(p) covers workers at permitted treatment, storage and disposal facilities. It mirrors the federal 1910.120(p):

- **24 hours** of initial training (or equivalent experience and training)
- **8 hours** of refresher training every year
- A safety and health program, hazard communication, medical surveillance, decontamination and an emergency response program

## DTSC (hazardous waste)

California's Department of Toxic Substances Control, under Title 22, requires facility personnel to be trained in hazardous waste management procedures for their jobs, with annual review and training records.

## Don't confuse them

The 24-hour TSDF course is not the same as the 24-hour HAZWOPER for occasional site workers. Make sure the course is written for §5192(p).

      body: `California is a state-plan state. Cal/OSHA's HAZWOPER rule is **Title 8 §5192**, and it must be at least as effective as the federal rule.

## In practice

- The training hours are the same: 40, 24 and 8-hour refreshers
- California's hazardous waste definitions are broader than federal RCRA, so more materials count as hazardous waste
- California has its own references, agencies and reporting (Cal/OSHA, DTSC, CUPAs)

## Which course?

Employers in California often prefer training that cites Title 8 and California rules. See [[577]] and [[578]].`,
