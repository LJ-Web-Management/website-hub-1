      body: `Equipment like switchboards, panelboards and PDUs that may be worked on while energized should carry an arc flash label.

## What you'll see

| Label item | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| **Nominal voltage** | The system voltage |
| **Arc flash boundary** | The distance where incident energy drops to 1.2 cal/cm². Inside it, you need arc-rated PPE |
| **Incident energy** at a working distance, or **PPE category** | How much energy could reach you, which sets the PPE |
| **Limited approach boundary** | Unqualified people must stay outside unless escorted |
| **Restricted approach boundary** | Only qualified people with shock protection go inside |
| **Date / study reference** | When the analysis was done |

## Watch for

- Labels older than the last system change (NFPA 70E calls for a review at least every 5 years)
- Very high incident energy. Some equipment shouldn't be worked energized at all
- Missing labels: stop and ask

      courses: [852, 831],
      body: `The safest approach is to de-energize. NFPA 70E describes how to create an **electrically safe work condition**:

1. **Identify all sources** of supply from drawings, one-lines and labels. Data centers often have more than one (utility, generator, UPS, batteries)
2. **Interrupt the load** and open the disconnecting devices
3. **Visually verify** blades are open or breakers withdrawn where possible
4. **Release stored energy**, such as capacitors in UPS systems
5. **Apply lockout/tagout** devices according to your program
6. **Test for absence of voltage** with a properly rated meter, checking it on a known source before and after
7. **Ground** where there's a possibility of induced voltage or stored energy

Until the absence of voltage is verified, treat the equipment as energized and wear the required PPE.

## In data centers

Watch for backfeed from UPS outputs, static transfer switches and dual-corded equipment. See [[852]].`,
