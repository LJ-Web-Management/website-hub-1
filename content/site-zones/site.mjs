## Step by step

1. **Characterize the site.** Where's the contamination? What are the hazards? See [[586]].
2. **Check the wind and terrain.** The support zone goes upwind and, where possible, uphill.
3. **Mark the exclusion zone** around all contaminated areas, with margin for vapors, dust and the work itself.
4. **Lay out the warm zone** as a buffer, with room for the decon corridor.
5. **Set access control points** where people and equipment enter and leave.
6. **Place the support zone**: command post, first aid, sanitation, break area and the muster point.
7. **Mark everything** with tape, fencing, cones and signs.
8. **Brief the crew** on the map, the routes and the emergency signals.

## Keep it current

Zones may move as work progresses, contamination is removed or the wind changes.

      body: `A windsock is one of the most important pieces of safety equipment on a hazardous waste site.

## Why it matters

The support zone is placed upwind so vapors and dust blow away from it. If the wind reverses, the clean zone can end up downwind of the work.

## What crews do

- **Watch the windsock** and report significant shifts
- **Monitor at the zone boundaries** and the support zone
- **Pause work** that generates vapors or dust if readings rise at the perimeter
- **Move the muster point** if it's now downwind
- **Relocate the decon line or support facilities** for longer-term shifts

## Plan ahead

Good site plans name an alternate muster point and describe how zones will be adjusted for a wind shift.
