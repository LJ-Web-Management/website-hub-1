      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [416, 1099],
      body: `Warehouses store everything from pool chemicals to paint to cleaning products, often in the same building. A leak becomes dangerous when incompatible products meet.

## Common incompatibles

| Keep apart | Why |
|---|---|
| Oxidizers (pool chlorine, some fertilizers) and flammables or combustibles | Fire |
| Acids and bases | Heat and splattering |
| Bleach and ammonia products | Toxic gas |
| Bleach and acids | Chlorine gas |
| Water-reactive products and anything wet | Heat, gas, fire |

## Practical rules

1. **Read the SDS.** Section 7 covers storage and Section 10 covers incompatibilities.
2. **Segregate by hazard class**, using separate aisles, distance or barriers.
3. **Flammables** belong in rated cabinets or rooms as the fire code requires.
4. **Store liquids low**, below solids, and away from rack edges.
5. **Secondary containment** for drums and totes.
6. **Keep spill kits** near chemical storage, matched to the products.

## Your local fire code

Fire codes set limits on how much of each hazard class can be stored in an area. Your fire marshal and insurer will check.

      body: `## 1. Stop and look

Don't drive through it or pick it up. Note what's leaking: label, product name, hazard pictograms.

## 2. Get clear and warn others

Back away and keep people out of the aisle.

## 3. Check the SDS

Find the product's safety data sheet. Sections 2, 6 and 8 cover hazards, spill response and PPE.

## 4. Decide: incidental or emergency?

**Incidental:** a small amount of a known product, no significant hazard, that trained staff can clean up with the spill kit and normal PPE.

**Emergency:** a large volume, an unknown product, fumes or odors, a fire risk, people feeling sick, or anything you're not sure about. Evacuate the area and call for help.

## 5. Clean up only if trained

Use the right kit and absorbent, cover drains, bag the waste and label it. See [[479]].

## 6. Damaged product may be waste

Leaked and damaged chemical products that can't be sold may be hazardous waste. Set them aside, labeled, for EHS.

## Warning signs

- Swelling or bulging
- Heat, smoke, hissing or a sweet chemical smell
- Cracked, punctured or crushed cases
- Leaking fluid

## If a battery is overheating

1. Keep people away
2. Don't pick it up with bare hands
3. If it's safe, move it to a non-combustible area or container designed for this, such as a metal bin with sand or vermiculite
4. Call your emergency number if it's smoking or burning

## Storing collected batteries

- Tape terminals or bag each battery to prevent short circuits
- Store in a cool, dry area away from combustibles
- Separate damaged batteries from intact ones

## Universal waste rules

Most waste batteries can be managed as **universal waste** under 40 CFR Part 273: labeled, accumulated for no more than one year and sent to a destination facility. Damaged lithium batteries also have special DOT shipping requirements.
