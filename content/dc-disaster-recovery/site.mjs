      body: `## RTO: recovery time objective

How long a service can be unavailable before the impact is unacceptable. An RTO of 4 hours means the service must be back within 4 hours.

## RPO: recovery point objective

How much data, measured in time, you can afford to lose. An RPO of 15 minutes means backups or replication must be no more than 15 minutes behind.

## Set them by business impact

| Service | Typical RTO | Typical RPO |
|---|---|---|
| Payments, trading | Minutes | Near zero |
| Customer portal | Hours | Minutes |
| Internal reporting | A day or more | Hours |

These are examples. Your business impact analysis sets the real numbers.

## Then design to meet them

Shorter RTOs and RPOs cost more: hot standby sites, synchronous replication, more staff. Match the spend to the impact, and test that you can actually meet the numbers.

      body: `A tabletop exercise walks the team through a realistic scenario around a table, without touching production.

## Prepare

- Pick a scenario: utility outage with a generator failure, a flooded basement, ransomware, a regional disaster
- Invite decision-makers from facilities, IT, security, communications and leadership
- Write 4–6 "injects": new developments released during the exercise

## Run it

1. Set the scene and the time
2. Ask each role what they do first, who they call and what they need
3. Release injects: "The generator fails to start." "Phones are down." "The press calls."
4. Note every gap, assumption and disagreement

## Debrief

- What worked?
- What was missing: contacts, procedures, authority, equipment?
- Assign each gap an owner and a date

Repeat at least once a year and after major changes. ICS-NIMS gives the command structure ([[880]]).`,
