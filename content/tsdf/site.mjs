      title: "TSDF training under 1910.120(p): 24 hours, then 8 every year",
      description: "Why TSD workers have their own paragraph in HAZWOPER, and what it requires.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [582, 594],
      body: `HAZWOPER covers three kinds of work. Cleanup sites are in paragraphs (b) through (o). Emergency response is in (q). And **operations at RCRA-permitted treatment, storage and disposal facilities** are in paragraph (p).

TSD facilities are controlled workplaces with known waste streams, engineering controls and a permit. OSHA's training requirement reflects that.

## The requirements

| Requirement | Paragraph | Hours |
|---|---|---|
| Initial training for new employees | (p)(7)(i) | 24 hours |
| Annual refresher | (p)(7)(i) | 8 hours |
| Emergency response training for those who respond | (p)(8) | As needed for the role |

Under (p)(7)(i), employees who have equivalent previous work experience or training can be certified by the employer as having it, instead of repeating the initial training. Keep the paperwork that shows why.

## What (p) also requires

- A written **safety and health program** for the facility
- A **hazard communication** program
- **Medical surveillance** for covered employees
- A **decontamination** program
- **New technology** evaluation
- **Material handling** procedures for drums and containers
- An **emergency response program**

Training should cover all of these, as they apply to each worker's job.

## The EPA side

EPA requires its own personnel training at TSDFs: 40 CFR 264.16 for permitted facilities and 265.16 for interim status facilities. It's within six months of assignment, with annual review, and with written records. One well-designed program can satisfy both. See [our recordkeeping guide](/guides/tsdf-training-records-osha-and-epa).

      title: "TSDF or cleanup site? Why the 40-hour isn't the default at a TSDF",
      description: "Workers move between facilities and field jobs. Here's which HAZWOPER paragraph covers which work.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [582, 599],
      body: `Environmental services companies often run a permitted facility and send crews to cleanup sites. The same person can be under different HAZWOPER paragraphs on different days.

## Which paragraph applies

| Work | Paragraph | Initial training |
|---|---|---|
| Cleanup at an uncontrolled hazardous waste site | (e) | 40 hours, or 24 for limited exposure |
| Operations at a RCRA-permitted or interim status TSDF | (p) | 24 hours |
| Emergency response to a release | (q) | Depends on responder level |

## Why TSD work needs fewer hours

A TSDF is a controlled environment. Waste is profiled before it arrives, processes are engineered and the hazards are known. An uncontrolled site has unknown contaminants, unknown concentrations and changing conditions. More unknowns mean more training.

## When a TSD worker goes to the field

If your facility technician is sent to a remediation site, or to pack a customer's lab waste on a contaminated property, they're doing (e) work. The 24-hour (p) training doesn't cover it. They need the 40-hour, or 24-hour if their exposure is limited, plus the field experience.

## A practical setup for mixed crews

- **Facility-only staff:** [[582]] and the annual [[594]]
- **Technicians who work in the facility and in the field:** [[599]] for the RCRA and technician side, plus the 40-hour HAZWOPER for field work
- **California facilities:** [[575]] and [[579]]

## Refreshers

Both paths need eight hours of refresher training a year. A worker covered by both (e) and (p) can usually meet both with one 8-hour refresher that covers the topics for both kinds of work. Document what the refresher covered.`,

      title: "OSHA and EPA training records at a TSDF: one system for both",
      description: "TSDFs answer to two agencies for training. Here's how to keep one set of records that satisfies both.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [582, 594, 599],
      body: `At a TSDF, an EPA RCRA inspector and an OSHA compliance officer can both ask for training records, and they're looking for different things.

## What EPA wants: 40 CFR 264.16(d)

- The **job title** for each position related to hazardous waste management, and the **name** of the employee in each
- A **written job description** for each position, including skills, education and duties
- A **written description of the type and amount of training**, both introductory and continuing, for each position
- **Records showing the training was completed** by facility personnel

Retention: current employees until closure, former employees for at least three years after they leave.

## What OSHA wants: 1910.120(p)

- Proof of the 24-hour initial training, or the employer's certification of equivalent experience
- Proof of the 8-hour annual refresher
- Emergency response training for employees who respond
- Medical surveillance records, kept under 29 CFR 1910.1020: duration of employment plus 30 years

## One system

Build one record per position and one record per person.

**Per position:** title, job description, and a training matrix listing OSHA (p) initial and refresher, EPA personnel training topics, emergency response role and any DOT hazmat function.

**Per person:** name and position, hire date and assignment date, certificates for each course with hours and dates, annual review sign-offs, and the employer's equivalency certification if one was used.

## The six-month and annual clocks

| Clock | Rule |
|---|---|
| EPA: train new hires within 6 months of assignment, supervised until then | 264.16(b) |
| EPA: annual review of training | 264.16(c) |
| OSHA: 24-hour initial before work | 1910.120(p)(7)(i) |
| OSHA: 8-hour refresher annually | 1910.120(p)(7)(i) |

The simplest approach is to give the OSHA 24-hour at hire, which also covers much of the EPA initial training, and use the 8-hour refresher as the EPA annual review.
