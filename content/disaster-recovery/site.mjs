      description: "Not all disaster work is HAZWOPER. Here's how to tell which tasks are.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [587, 1099],
      body: `After a hurricane, flood or wildfire, thousands of workers arrive to clean up. Some of that work falls under HAZWOPER. Much of it doesn't.

## Usually not HAZWOPER

- Removing ordinary storm debris such as trees, building materials and household items
- Mucking out flooded homes and mold remediation (covered by other OSHA rules and guidance)
- Restoring power and utilities, which follows utility safety standards

These jobs still have serious hazards, and OSHA's general rules on PPE, respirators, hazard communication and others apply.

## Often HAZWOPER

- **Collecting orphaned containers**: drums, propane tanks, cylinders and household hazardous waste
- **Responding to chemical releases** from flooded plants, storage tanks or pipelines (emergency response under (q))
- **Cleaning up hazardous substances** as part of a government-directed cleanup
- **Working at contaminated industrial sites** damaged by the disaster

## Grey areas

Debris piles can hide hazardous materials. Crews doing general debris work should have awareness training ([[1099]]), so that when they find a drum or a hissing tank, they stop and report it instead of loading it.

## The safest approach

Many disaster contractors require HAZWOPER for crews likely to encounter hazardous materials, and awareness training for everyone else.

      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1099, 587],
      body: `Floodwater lifts drums, propane tanks, gas cylinders and household chemical containers and leaves them in fields, ditches and debris piles. EPA and state agencies often run dedicated programs to collect them after major floods.

## If you find one

1. **Stop and don't touch it.** Containers may be damaged, pressurized or leaking.
2. **Look from a distance.** Labels, placards, odor, hissing, frost on a cylinder, bulging or leaks.
3. **Mark and report it** to your supervisor or the agency running orphan container collection.
4. **Keep moving equipment away** from it.

## Why they're dangerous

- Propane and other compressed gas cylinders can leak or rupture.
- Unknown chemicals can be toxic, corrosive or reactive.
- Mixed debris can combine incompatible chemicals.
- Containers weakened by water and impact can fail when lifted.

## Who collects them

Collection is HAZWOPER work, done by trained crews with a plan, PPE, monitoring and proper containers for overpacking. If your crew does it, everyone needs HAZWOPER training ([[587]]).

      body: `Disaster recovery is long days in tough conditions. These are the hazards that injure recovery workers most often.

## Heat

Many recoveries happen in hot weather. Work-rest cycles, shade, water and acclimatization for new arrivals are essential, especially in protective clothing.

## Contaminated floodwater

Floodwater can carry sewage, fuel, chemicals and debris. Wear waterproof boots and gloves, cover cuts, wash before eating and decontaminate gear. See [[584]].

## Carbon monoxide

Portable generators, pressure washers and pumps produce carbon monoxide. Never run them indoors or near open windows and doors.

## Fuel spills

Damaged tanks and vehicles leak fuel. Keep ignition sources away and contain spills before they reach drains. See [[416]].

## Fatigue

Long shifts for weeks on end lead to mistakes. Rotate tasks, schedule rest days and watch each other.

## Wildfire ash

Ash from burned buildings can contain metals, asbestos and other hazards. Wet methods, respirators and protective clothing are standard for burned-structure cleanup.`,
