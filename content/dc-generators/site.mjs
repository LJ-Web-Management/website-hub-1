      body: `## Batteries

Weak or failed starting batteries are among the most common causes. Check voltage, electrolyte where applicable, connections and chargers regularly, and replace on schedule.

## Fuel

- Water and microbial growth in stored diesel
- Clogged filters
- Air in the fuel lines after maintenance
- Day tank pumps or controls that don't refill

## Controls left in the wrong position

A generator left in "off" or "manual" after maintenance won't answer an auto-start signal. Check switch positions as part of every handover.

## Cooling and heating

Failed block heaters make cold starts slow or impossible. Coolant leaks lead to shutdowns under load.

## Wet stacking

Diesels run for long periods at light load can build up unburned fuel in the exhaust. Load bank testing helps burn it off.

## Prevention

Follow NFPA 110 inspection and testing, run monthly tests under load, and load bank test as required.

      body: `## What goes wrong

- **Water** from condensation collects at the bottom of the tank
- **Microbes** grow at the fuel-water interface and make sludge
- **Oxidation** forms gums and sediment over time

## What to do

1. **Test** fuel on a schedule (commonly annually) for water, sediment and microbial growth
2. **Drain water** from tank sumps regularly
3. **Polish** fuel by filtering and recirculating it
4. **Keep tanks full** to limit condensation, where your SPCC plan allows
5. **Record** every delivery, test and treatment

## Spill risks

Fuel deliveries, overfills and tank leaks are the main spill risks at most data centers. Watch every delivery, use secondary containment and keep spill kits nearby. See [[416]] and [[479]].`,
