      body: `Redundancy is described relative to **N**, the capacity needed to carry the full IT load.

| Model | What it means | Example (load needs 4 units) |
|---|---|---|
| N | Exactly enough, no spare | 4 units |
| N+1 | One spare component | 5 units |
| N+2 | Two spare components | 6 units |
| 2N | A complete second system | 2 × 4 units, on separate paths |
| 2N+1 | Two systems plus a spare | 2 × 4 units + 1 |

## Components vs paths

N+1 adds spare **components** (a fifth chiller, a fifth UPS module). 2N adds a whole second **distribution path**, so a failure or maintenance on one path doesn't touch the load. That difference matters more than the unit count.

## How to choose

- **What does downtime cost** per hour for the workloads in the room?
- **Must you maintain without shutdowns?** If yes, you need concurrently maintainable paths, not just spare units.
- **What does the next increment cost** in capital, space, and efficiency (lightly loaded equipment runs less efficiently)?

Many facilities mix models: 2N power to the rack, N+1 cooling, N+1 generators.

- Utility capacity available now, and the timeline for more
- Number of independent feeds and substations
- Cost per kWh and renewable options

## Connectivity

- Diverse fiber routes from more than one carrier
- Distance to internet exchanges and cloud on-ramps

## Natural and man-made risk

- Flood zones, seismic activity, hurricanes and tornadoes
- Proximity to airports, rail lines, chemical plants and pipelines

## Climate and water

- Hours per year suitable for economizer (free) cooling
- Water availability and cost if you plan evaporative cooling

## Land, permits and people

- Room to expand, zoning, permitting time, tax incentives
- A local workforce for operations and trades

Score each site against the same weighted list, and revisit capacity forecasts ([[829]]) before you commit.`,
