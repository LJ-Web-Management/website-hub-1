      body: `## Common hazards

- **Methamphetamine residue** on walls, ceilings, floors, furniture and inside ductwork
- **Solvents** and flammable liquids
- **Corrosives**: acids and bases
- **Toxic gases** from leftover reactions, such as phosphine and hydrogen chloride
- **Lithium, red phosphorus and iodine** depending on the production method
- **Sharps** and drug paraphernalia
- **Booby traps** at active or recently seized labs (law enforcement clears these first)

## Before your crew enters

- Make sure law enforcement has released the site and bulk chemicals have been removed
- Review any assessment or sampling reports
- Monitor the air (see [[583]])
- Set up zones and a decon area

## State rules

Many states have their own cleanup standards, contractor certification and sampling requirements for former drug labs. Check your state's program.

2. **Ventilate** with fresh air and negative air machines where appropriate
3. **Remove contaminated materials**: carpets, furniture, drywall and ductwork that can't be cleaned
4. **Clean** remaining surfaces, often with detergent washes and rinses, repeated as needed
5. **Clean or replace HVAC** and plumbing traps
6. **Encapsulate** surfaces that pass cleanup but may still hold residue, if allowed
7. **Final sampling** against your state's cleanup standards
8. **Documentation** for the property owner and the state

## Protect the crew

PPE based on the assessment and monitoring ([[585]]), and decon every time workers leave the work area ([[584]]).`,
