      body: `## 1. List every asset

Generators, UPS, batteries, switchgear, transfer switches, PDUs, chillers, CRAHs, pumps, cooling towers, fire systems, BMS controllers. Give each an ID and record make, model, serial and location.

## 2. Rank by criticality

What happens to the IT load if this fails? Critical assets get the most attention.

## 3. Set tasks and intervals

Start from manufacturer recommendations and standards (such as NFPA 70B for electrical, NFPA 110 for generators, NFPA 25 for water-based fire systems). Adjust with experience.

## 4. Load it into a CMMS

Work orders generate automatically. Every task has steps, tools, safety requirements and a MOP for anything that affects redundancy.

## 5. Measure

- PM completion rate (aim very high on critical assets)
- Corrective work found during PMs
- Repeat failures

## 6. Improve

Add predictive methods like infrared, vibration and oil analysis where they pay off.

      body: `## Roof (at least twice a year and after storms)

- Drains and scuppers clear
- No ponding water, blisters, splits or open seams
- Flashing intact around equipment curbs and penetrations
- Rooftop equipment supports sound, with no leaks at condensate lines

## Walls, doors and windows

- Sealant and joints intact
- Doors seal and close fully (also a security issue)
- No signs of water at the base of walls

## Inside

- Ceiling stains, especially above white space and electrical rooms
- Leak detection cable alarms tested

## Fall protection

Roof work needs fall protection: guardrails, warning lines or personal fall arrest near edges and skylights.
