## The full cost of a new 40-hour worker

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Course seat | $249.99 for [[587]] |
| Paid training time | 40 hours of wages, often the largest single cost |
| Field experience | 3 days under a supervisor, often on a real job |
| Medical exam | Before assignment, if covered by medical surveillance |
| Respirator fit test | Before respirator use and every 12 months |
| PPE | Boots, gloves, suits and respirator |

## The yearly cost of a certified worker

- [[595]] at $89.99 per seat
- 8 hours of paid time
- Annual fit test and, for most, an annual medical exam

## Ways to save

1. **Online courses.** No travel and no trainer day rate, and workers can train on slow days or between jobs.
2. **One renewal month.** Line up refreshers, fit tests and medicals for the whole crew in the same month.
3. **Train the right level.** Not everyone needs 40 hours. Workers who qualify can take [[581]].
4. **Build field days into real work.** The first project a new hire works on can be their supervised field experience.
5. **An in-house trainer** pays off for larger crews. See [[1016]].

## Plan for turnover

Budget for new hires through the year, not just the start-of-season crew.`,

      description: "Their certificate came from another employer. What to check before they start.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [595, 587],
      body: `A new hire with a HAZWOPER card can save you 40 hours of training, if the card holds up.

## Check the paperwork

1. **The initial certificate.** 40 or 24 hours, the provider, the date and the worker's name.
2. **Refreshers.** Is the most recent one within the last 12 months? If not, they need [[595]] before starting.
3. **Field experience.** Is there a record of the supervised days? If not, plan to provide them.
4. **Supervisor training**, if they'll lead others.
5. **Medical clearance and fit test**, current for your program.

## Equivalent training

29 CFR 1910.120(e)(9) lets employers accept prior training and experience as equivalent, if they can show it. Document what you reviewed and why you accepted it.

## Red flags

- A certificate with no hours or no provider listed
- Gaps of several years with no refresher
- A card that doesn't match the worker's name or ID
- Training from a provider you can't verify

When in doubt, retraining costs less than defending a citation.

## Site-specific orientation

Even a fully certified worker needs your site's briefing: your site safety plan, your PPE, your emergency procedures. That's required for every worker on every site.`,

      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [587, 1016],
      body: `There's no single right answer. Most contractors end up using both.

## Online works best for

- **The classroom hours** of the 40-hour, 24-hour and refresher
- Workers spread across sites or states
- Crews who need to train between jobs or on rain days
- Keeping cost and travel down

## In-person works best for

- **Hands-on skills:** donning and doffing PPE, respirator fit, decon line practice, monitor use
- The **supervised field experience** OSHA requires after the initial course
- Workers who learn better with an instructor in the room

## The blended model

1. Workers complete the online course on their own time.
2. A supervisor or in-house trainer runs a hands-on day: PPE, decon and instruments.
3. The worker's first days on a real site serve as the supervised field experience.

## Checklist for any provider

- Does the course cover all the topics in 1910.120(e)?
- Can workers ask a qualified person questions?
- Does each worker get a certificate with hours, date and provider?
- Can you see completion status for the whole crew?`,
