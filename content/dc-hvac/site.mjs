|---|---|---|
| Name | Computer room air conditioner | Computer room air handler |
| Cooling source | Its own refrigeration compressor (DX) | Chilled water from a central plant |
| Heat rejection | Condenser (air-cooled, water or glycol) | The chiller plant |
| Typical site | Smaller rooms and older sites | Larger facilities |
| Main hazards | Refrigerant pressure, compressor electrical | Water leaks, valves, pumps |

## Troubleshooting differences

**CRAC:** check refrigerant pressures, superheat and subcooling, compressor amps, condenser airflow and coil condition.

**CRAH:** check chilled water supply and return temperatures, valve position and actuator, flow, and coil condition.

## Both

Filters, belts or EC fan motors, humidifiers, condensate drains and controls.

      body: `## 1. Know what normal looks like

Write down normal pressures, temperatures and amps for each unit on a good day. Faults are easier to see against a baseline.

## 2. Check redundancy before you touch anything

Confirm the backup unit is running and carrying load before you take a unit offline.

## 3. Start simple

Power, controls, filters, belts and valves before compressors and boards.

## 4. Change one thing at a time

Then measure again. Otherwise you'll never know what fixed it.

## 5. Respect the refrigerant

High pressure, frostbite and oxygen displacement in enclosed spaces. Technicians who handle refrigerants need EPA Section 608 certification. See [[851]] for refrigerant safety.

Write up what you found and what you did, for the next tech.`,
