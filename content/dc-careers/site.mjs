- **Electricians** and electrical apprentices
- **HVAC and refrigeration technicians**
- **Military** technicians, especially from power, communications and nuclear roles
- **Building engineers** from hospitals, labs or large offices
- **IT and network technicians** who want to move toward infrastructure

## What hiring managers look for

- Safety habits, especially around electrical and mechanical equipment
- Willingness to follow procedures exactly (MOPs and SOPs)
- Shift flexibility: data centers run 24/7
- Clean background checks for secure sites

## Learn first

Electrical safety ([[852]]), raised floor and confined space awareness ([[856]]) and ergonomics ([[858]]) show you understand the environment. Then pick a track on the map.

      body: `## Technician

You carry out maintenance, rounds and work orders, and respond to alarms.

## Senior technician / lead

You write and review MOPs, lead maintenance windows, train newer techs and make the first call during incidents.

## Critical facilities engineer

You own systems: power ([[847]]), cooling ([[841]]) or both. You plan maintenance, analyze failures and work with vendors.

## Facility or operations manager

You run the team, budget and the relationship with customers and leadership. See [[843]].

## How to move up

- Volunteer for MOPs, commissioning and incident reviews
- Learn the one-line and the mechanical drawings cold
- Take a comprehensive course in your track
- Add a second track: power people who understand cooling (and vice versa) stand out`,
