      title: "The five levels of HAZWOPER emergency responders",
      description: "From awareness to incident commander: what each level does, what it may not do and the minimum training.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1099, 593, 574],
      body: `29 CFR 1910.120(q)(6) sorts emergency responders by **what they're expected to do**, not by job title. Assign people to a level based on their role in your emergency response plan, then train them for it.

## The levels

| Level | Role | Minimum training |
|---|---|---|
| First responder, awareness | Discovers the release, notifies and takes no further action | Enough training or demonstrated competency to do that role |
| First responder, operations | Protects people, property and the environment from a safe distance, defensively, without trying to stop the release | 8 hours, or demonstrated competency |
| Hazardous materials technician | Approaches the point of release to plug, patch or stop it | 24 hours at operations-level content, plus listed competencies |
| Hazardous materials specialist | Supports technicians with specific knowledge of substances | 24 hours at technician-level content, plus competencies |
| On-scene incident commander | Takes control of the incident above the awareness level | 24 hours at operations-level content, plus listed competencies |

## Awareness: the most common, and most misunderstood

Awareness-level responders don't contain, absorb or stop anything. They **recognize, isolate and notify**. If your security guard is expected to throw absorbent on a leaking drum, they aren't awareness level anymore. Either train them to operations level, or change the plan.

## Competency, not just hours

Each level comes with competencies the employer must be able to show. For example, an awareness responder must understand what hazardous substances are, recognize their presence, identify them if possible, understand their role in the plan and know how to notify. Certificates prove hours. Drills prove competency.

## Every year

Under (q)(8), responders need annual refresher training of enough content and length to keep their competencies, or a yearly demonstration of competency. Keep a record of whichever method you use.

      title: "Does your facility need an emergency response team, or just an evacuation plan?",
      description: "Paragraph (q) has an exit. If your people evacuate and never respond, the rules are very different.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [702, 1099],
      body: `Every facility that handles hazardous substances has to decide one thing first: **when something releases, do our people respond, or do they leave?**

## Option 1: evacuate

Under 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(1), employers who evacuate employees from the danger area when an emergency occurs, and don't let them help handle it, are exempt from the HAZWOPER (q) requirements. They must have an **emergency action plan** that meets 29 CFR 1910.38.

That means:

- Alarm and reporting procedures
- Evacuation routes and assembly points
- A way to account for everyone
- Training so employees know the plan

You still need awareness-level thinking (recognize a release and report it), and the local fire department or a hazmat contractor does the responding.

## Option 2: respond

If any employee will take action on a release beyond incidental cleanup, such as containing it, stopping it or rescuing someone, you're doing emergency response under (q). You'll need:

- A written **emergency response plan** under (q)(1) and (q)(2)
- Responders trained to the level of their role
- An incident command system
- PPE, monitoring equipment and decon
- Medical surveillance for hazmat team members
- Annual refresher training or demonstrated competency

## How to choose

| Question | Leans evacuate | Leans respond |
|---|---|---|
| How fast can the fire department arrive? | Minutes | Far away or slow |
| Can a release shut down your process or hurt neighbors before help arrives? | Unlikely | Likely |
| Do you have staff who can train and stay current? | No | Yes |
| Do you have the PPE and equipment? | No | Yes |

## A middle path

Many plants evacuate most staff but keep a trained **in-plant ERT** at the operations level. The ERT protects people and contains from a distance until the fire department takes over. That's a (q) program, but a focused one. See [[702]].`,

      title: "Incidental spill or emergency response? Where the line falls",
      description: "Wiping up a quart of solvent isn't a hazmat response. A leaking tote might be. OSHA's test for telling them apart.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1099, 702],
      body: `HAZWOPER's emergency response rules don't apply to every spill. OSHA separates **incidental releases** from **emergency responses**, and the difference decides what training your people need.

## OSHA's definition

Under 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3), responses to incidental releases are not emergency responses. An incidental release is one that can be absorbed, neutralized or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate work area or by maintenance staff, and where there's no potential safety or health hazard. The danger is the deciding factor, not the size.

## The questions to ask

A release is likely an **emergency** if:

- It could cause high levels of exposure to toxic substances
- It's an immediate danger to life or health, or an oxygen-deficient atmosphere
- It creates a fire or explosion hazard
- It requires evacuating the area
- The people nearby don't know what it is, or aren't trained or equipped to handle it
- It needs outside help to control

A release is likely **incidental** if:

- The material and its hazards are known
- The quantity is small enough that nearby workers can control it with the equipment and PPE they normally use
- Their normal training covers it

## Same chemical, different answer

| Situation | Likely |
|---|---|
| A cup of hydraulic oil drips from a forklift. The operator puts down an absorbent pad. | Incidental |
| A 275-gallon tote of sodium hypochlorite is punctured in a warehouse aisle. | Emergency |
| A lab tech spills 100 mL of a known solvent in a fume hood. | Incidental |
| An ammonia odor is reported in a refrigerated room, source unknown. | Emergency |

## What it means for training

- People who handle **incidental** spills need training on the hazards of the chemicals they use (hazard communication) and on the spill kit.
- People who respond to **emergencies** need (q) training for their responder level.
- People who'll **discover** an emergency need awareness training: recognize, isolate and notify.
