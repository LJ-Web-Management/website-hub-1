      body: `The level of protection isn't fixed for the whole job. The site safety plan sets the starting level and the conditions for changing it.

## Typical upgrade triggers

- Readings above an action level in the breathing zone
- Unknown drums, odors or staining found during work
- Moving into a more contaminated area
- Change in task, for example from walking the site to opening containers
- Change in weather that affects vapor levels

## Typical downgrade triggers

- Monitoring data shows sustained low readings
- Contaminants are identified and confirmed below limits
- The most hazardous phase of work is complete

## Why downgrading matters

Higher levels bring heat stress, fatigue, poor visibility and slower work. Staying in Level B when Level C or D is safe raises the risk of heat illness and accidents. Good programs move down as soon as the data supports it.

## Who decides

The site safety officer or supervisor, using the plan's action levels. Workers should never change their own level without direction. See [[597]].`,

      body: `## Before entry

- Medical clearance and a recent check of vital signs
- Hydrate well before suiting up
- Inspect the suit, zippers, gloves and boots
- Check SCBA cylinder pressure and do a function test
- Set a work time based on air supply and heat, not just the task

## During entry

- Work in buddy pairs with a backup team suited and ready
- Use hand signals for "out of air," "need help" and "leaving now"
- Leave with enough air to finish decon
- Watch your partner for signs of heat stress

## After entry

- Full decon before doffing
- Rest, rehydrate and check vital signs again
- Note any suit damage or problems for the team

## Heat is the main risk

Encapsulating suits trap almost all body heat. Work periods in hot weather can be as short as 15 to 20 minutes. Cooling vests and shaded rest areas help.
