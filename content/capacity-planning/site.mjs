      body: `**Stranded capacity** is power, cooling or space you've paid for but can't use, because another resource runs out first.

## Common examples

- Racks with free space but no power left on their circuits
- Power available in one room, cooling available in another
- Cooling capacity tied up by poor airflow (hot spots force low setpoints)
- Breakers and PDUs reserved for equipment that was never installed
- Floor-loading limits that stop dense racks

## How to find it

Compare **design capacity**, **provisioned capacity** and **actual measured load** for power, cooling, space and network ports, by room and by rack. DCIM tools help ([[830]]).

## How to recover it

- Rebalance loads across circuits and PDUs
- Fix airflow so cooling can be used where it's needed
- Release reservations nobody is using
- Plan new deployments where all four resources line up

      body: `## Start with the trend

Plot monthly peak IT load for the last two years. Fit a simple trend.

## Add known demand

Ask IT and customers about planned deployments, refreshes and migrations. Add them as steps on top of the trend.

## Set thresholds

Choose the point at which you need more capacity, often around 80% of usable capacity, leaving room for redundancy and surprises.

## Work back from lead times

New power or cooling capacity can take months to years. Your decision date is the threshold date minus the lead time.

## Revisit often

Update the forecast quarterly. Watch rack densities: higher kW per rack can exhaust cooling long before space runs out. See [[842]] for design options.`,
