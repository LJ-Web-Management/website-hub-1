  ["Training", "What is HAZWOPER?", "Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response: the OSHA standard at 29 CFR 1910.120 (and 1926.65 for construction) covering cleanup sites, treatment, storage and disposal facilities, and emergency response to hazardous substance releases."],
  ["Training", "Do I need the 40-hour or the 24-hour?", "The 40-hour is for general site workers who may be exposed at or above exposure limits or need respirators. The 24-hour is for workers on site only occasionally for limited tasks, or in monitored areas below exposure limits without respirators."],
  ["Training", "Is online HAZWOPER training valid?", "Online courses can cover the classroom hours. The initial courses also require supervised field experience on site (3 days for the 40-hour, 1 day for the 24-hour), which your employer provides."],
  ["Training", "How long does the 40-hour take?", "40 hours of instruction. Online and self-paced, many people finish in one to two weeks working a few hours a day."],
  ["Training", "Do supervisors need extra training?", "Yes. Supervisors need the same initial training as their workers plus at least 8 hours of specialized supervisor training."],
  ["Training", "What training do emergency responders need?", "It depends on the role: awareness, operations, technician, specialist or incident commander, each with its own requirements under 1910.120(q)(6)."],
  ["Training", "What about workers at a TSD facility?", "Workers at permitted treatment, storage and disposal facilities need 24 hours of initial training and 8 hours of refresher training each year under paragraph (p)."],
  ["Refreshers", "How often do I need a refresher?", "Eight hours of refresher training every year (12 months)."],
  ["Refreshers", "What if my refresher lapsed?", "You're out of compliance until you complete one. For a short lapse, take the refresher right away. After a long lapse, your employer may require the initial course again."],
  ["Refreshers", "Can I take the refresher early?", "Yes. Your next refresher is then due 12 months from the new date."],
  ["Refreshers", "Is there a grace period?", "The federal standard doesn't provide one. Plan renewals ahead."],
  ["Certificates", "Do I get a certificate?", "Yes. Each course provides a certificate of completion. Keep copies of every certificate, including refreshers."],
  ["Certificates", "Does my certificate expire?", "The initial certificate stays valid as long as you keep up the annual refreshers."],
  ["Certificates", "Will my certificate work in another state?", "The hours are the same everywhere. A few state plans write their own HAZWOPER rule, such as California, Washington and Michigan, and employers there may want state-specific refresher training."],
  ["Certificates", "Can my employer accept training from another company?", "Yes. Employers can accept documented equivalent training and experience under 1910.120(e)(9)."],
  ["Enrollment", "How do I enroll?", "Click Enroll on any course, choose the number of seats and pay by card. Login details arrive by email."],
  ["Enrollment", "Can I buy seats for my crew?", "Yes. Set the number of seats at checkout. For invoices or purchase orders, call +1-866-429-6742 or email info@hazwoper-osha.com."],
  ["Enrollment", "Is there a course in Spanish?", "Yes. The OSHA 40-Hour HAZWOPER is available in Spanish."],
  ["Enrollment", "Can I take the course on my phone?", "Yes. The courses work on phones, tablets and computers, and progress saves as you go."],
  ["On the job", "What are the PPE levels?", "Level A (fully encapsulating suit and SCBA), Level B (SCBA with splash protection), Level C (air-purifying respirator with chemical-resistant clothing) and Level D (work uniform)."],
  ["On the job", "What are the site zones?", "Exclusion zone (hot), contamination reduction zone (warm, where decon happens) and support zone (cold)."],
  ["On the job", "What is a site safety and health plan?", "The written, site-specific plan required by 1910.120(b)(4), covering hazards, training, PPE, medical surveillance, monitoring, site control, decon, emergencies, confined spaces and spill containment."],
  ["On the job", "Do I need medical surveillance?", "Covered workers include those exposed at or above limits 30 or more days a year, respirator wearers for 30 or more days a year, HAZMAT team members, and workers injured or ill from possible overexposure."],
  ["On the job", "Does HAZWOPER apply to every spill?", "No. Incidental releases that people in the area can safely control aren't emergency responses under HAZWOPER."],

Bring your 40-hour (or 24-hour) certificate, your latest refresher, ID and any medical clearance and fit test records your employer asks for.

## Orientation

Every site runs its own orientation: the site safety and health plan, hazards, zones, PPE by task, emergency signals and the muster point.

## The tailgate

Each morning, the crew meets for a briefing on the day's tasks, hazards and action levels. Ask questions.

## Your field days

If you're new, your first days are your supervised field experience: real tasks with a supervisor watching and signing off.

## Decon

Before breaks and at the end of the day you'll go through decon. Learn the order and don't skip steps.

## When in doubt

Stop and ask. Every good site wants you to.

| Everyone, every year | [[595]] |

## What else am I responsible for?

The supervised field experience, a written safety and health program, site safety plans, PPE and respirator programs, medical surveillance for covered workers, and records.

## Can I buy in bulk?

Yes. Choose the number of seats at checkout, or call for an invoice or purchase order.

## How do I keep everyone current?

Track each worker's due date and set reminders. Many employers line the whole crew up on one renewal month.`,
