## Where campus hazardous waste comes from

| Department | Typical waste |
|---|---|
| Chemistry, biology, engineering labs | Solvents, reagents, acids, metals |
| Art and theater | Paints, solvents, photo chemicals, glazes |
| Facilities and maintenance | Paints, adhesives, oils, lamps, batteries |
| Motor pool | Used oil, antifreeze, solvents, batteries |
| Athletics and pools | Pool chemicals |
| Grounds | Pesticides, fuel |
| IT | Electronics and batteries |
| Medical center | Pharmaceuticals and lab waste |

## Suggested training

| Role | Course |
|---|---|
| Anyone who fills a waste container | [[415]] |
| EHS and waste technicians | [[601]], then [[600]] yearly |
| Facilities and IT | [[602]] |
| Custodians and campus police | [[1099]] |
| Emergency coordinators | [[412]] |

## Students

Students in labs and studios generate waste too. Most campuses cover the basics in lab safety orientation and post simple rules at every satellite area.`,

      title: "Art studios and theater shops: the forgotten generators",
      description: "Paints, solvents and photo chemicals make art departments hazardous waste generators. How to bring them into the program.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [415],
      body: `EHS programs often focus on research labs and miss the art building. Yet studios and scene shops generate plenty of hazardous waste.

## Common art and theater wastes

- **Solvents**: mineral spirits, turpentine and lacquer thinners from painting and printmaking
- **Oil-based paints** and stains
- **Photo chemicals**: fixers containing silver
- **Ceramics**: glazes with metals such as lead, barium and chromium
- **Aerosol paints and fixatives**
- **Rags** soaked with solvents and oils, which can also be a spontaneous combustion fire hazard

## Making it work

1. **Set up satellite accumulation areas** in each studio, with labeled containers and a pickup schedule
2. **Provide self-closing safety cans** for solvent waste and oily rags
3. **Train studio technicians**, who are the people actually running the areas. See [[415]].
4. **Post simple instructions** for students: what goes where
5. **Recycle where possible**: solvent recovery, silver recovery from fixer

## Inspection tip

Inspectors find the same problems in studios as in labs: open containers, missing "Hazardous Waste" labels and waste stored far from where it's generated.

      body: `A spill in a teaching lab at 9 p.m. tests whether everyone knows their role.

## Typical roles

| Who | Role |
|---|---|
| Lab personnel | Clean up small spills of known materials they're trained for, with the lab's spill kit. Otherwise evacuate and call |
| Custodians and building staff | Recognize, keep people away, call. Don't clean up chemical spills |
| Campus police | Secure the area, help evacuate, call EHS and the fire department |
| EHS | Assess, decide on cleanup or outside help, document |
| Fire department / hazmat contractor | Larger or unknown releases |

## Incidental vs emergency

Small, known spills that the people in the area can safely handle are incidental. Anything bigger, unknown or dangerous is an emergency: evacuate and call.

## Training

- Custodians and police: [[1099]]
- Lab staff: lab-specific spill training plus the spill kit
- EHS and emergency coordinators: [[412]] if you're an LQG

## After the spill

Spill cleanup materials are often hazardous waste. Bag, label and send them to the waste program.`,
