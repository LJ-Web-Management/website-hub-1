      body: `Generator category is based on the amount of hazardous waste you **generate in a calendar month**, not how much you ship or store.

## Count

- Hazardous waste accumulated on site before shipment
- Waste packaged and shipped off site
- Waste placed directly in on-site treatment or disposal

## Generally don't count

- Waste managed under the universal waste rules
- Used oil managed under the used oil rules
- Waste that's exempt or excluded (for example, some recycled materials)
- Waste already counted once

## Acute hazardous waste is counted separately

More than 1 kg of acute hazardous waste in a month makes you an LQG on its own, no matter how little other waste you generate.

## Keep records

Track monthly totals so you can show your category if an inspector asks.

      body: `A one-time event, like a tank cleanout, a lab cleanout or a spill, can push a VSQG or SQG into a higher category for that month.

## The federal episodic generation rule

Under 40 CFR 262 Subpart L, a VSQG or SQG can keep its normal category during an **episodic event** if it:

- Notifies EPA or the state before a planned event (or within 72 hours of an unplanned one)
- Gets an EPA ID number if it doesn't have one
- Labels and manages the episodic waste properly
- Ships it off with a manifest within 60 days

Generally one event a year is allowed, with a petition for one more.

## Not every state has adopted it

Check your state's rules before you count on it.

## Otherwise

Without the rule, you must meet the higher category's requirements for that month. See [[600]] for an annual refresher.`,
