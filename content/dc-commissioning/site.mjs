      body: `Integrated systems testing (IST) proves that power, cooling, controls and fire systems work together under realistic load.

## Set up

- **Load banks** in the white space to simulate IT heat and power
- **Temperature sensors** across the room to record conditions
- **Scripts** for each test with pass/fail criteria, approved in advance
- **Everyone briefed**: contractors, vendors, the owner, operations staff

## Typical tests

1. Utility failure: UPS carries the load, generators start, transfer, recover
2. Generator failure while on generator power
3. Chiller or CRAH failure: does the redundant unit pick up in time?
4. Controls or BMS failure: does equipment fail to a safe state?
5. Return to utility

## Pass criteria

No interruption to the simulated IT load, temperatures within limits, alarms correct, sequences as designed.

## Afterwards

Fix the failures, retest, and record everything. Operations staff who witness IST learn the building better than any manual can teach.

## Documents

- As-built drawings, including the one-line diagrams
- Commissioning reports for every level, with resolved issues
- Operation and maintenance manuals, warranties, spare parts lists
- Controls sequences and BMS point lists

## Training

- Vendor training on UPS, generators, switchgear, chillers and controls
- Walkdowns of every system with the people who installed it

## Procedures

- SOPs, MOPs and EOPs written and tested before go-live
- Maintenance plans loaded into the CMMS

## Open items

Agree in writing on every open punch list item, who fixes it and by when.

Learn UPS ([[840]]) and generator ([[835]]) testing so your team can repeat it every year.`,
