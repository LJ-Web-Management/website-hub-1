      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [403],
      body: `Hazmat drivers often hear "you need training" without hearing which training. There are three separate pieces.

## 1. The hazmat endorsement (H)

To drive a placarded load in a commercial vehicle, a driver needs the **H endorsement** on their CDL. That means a knowledge test and a TSA security threat assessment. It's a licensing requirement, not employer training.

## 2. DOT hazmat employee training (49 CFR 172.704)

Every hazmat employee, drivers included, needs training from their employer:

- General awareness and familiarization
- Function-specific training for their tasks
- Safety training: emergency response information and protective measures
- Security awareness, plus in-depth security training if the company has a security plan

**Within 90 days** of starting, and **at least every three years**.

## 3. Hazmat driver training (49 CFR 177.816)

Drivers also need training on operating a vehicle carrying hazmat, covering:

- Pre-trip safety inspections
- Use of vehicle controls and equipment, including emergency equipment
- Operation, including turning, backing, braking, parking and handling
- Procedures for tunnels, bridges and railroad crossings
- Attending vehicles, parking, smoking and route restrictions
- Loading and unloading

## Keep records

Carriers keep a training record for each hazmat employee for as long as they're employed and 90 days after.

      courses: [1099, 479],
      body: `You notice a leak at a fuel stop, or after a minor crash. Here's what to do.

## 1. Protect yourself

Get out of the vapor and liquid. Move upwind and uphill. Don't touch or walk through the material.

## 2. Keep people back

Stop bystanders and other drivers from approaching. Use warning devices as you would for any stopped vehicle, if safe to do so.

## 3. Call it in

Call 911, then your dispatcher. Have ready:

- The **shipping papers**, which list the material, hazard class, UN number and an emergency response phone number. They must be within reach while you're at the controls, and on the driver's seat or in the door pocket when you leave the cab.
- Your location
- What's leaking and how much

## 4. Use the ERG

Look up the UN number for initial isolation distances and hazards.

## 5. Contain only if it's safe

A small, known leak may be stopped or contained with your spill kit if you're trained and it's safe. See [[479]]. Otherwise, wait for responders.

## 6. Report

Serious incidents must be reported under 49 CFR 171.15 and 171.16. Your carrier's safety department handles this, but your notes matter.

      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [580, 403],
      body: `Hazardous waste transporters follow DOT hazmat rules **and** EPA's transporter rules at 40 CFR Part 263.

## Key EPA requirements

- **EPA ID number.** A transporter can't move hazardous waste without one.
- **Manifest.** Accept waste only with a properly completed manifest. Sign and date it, give the generator a copy, carry it with the load and get the next handler's signature.
- **Deliver as directed.** Deliver the entire quantity to the designated facility, or the alternate listed.
- **Records.** Keep a copy of the manifest for three years.
- **e-Manifest.** Many shipments now use electronic manifests.

## Spills during transport

Under 40 CFR 263.30 and 263.31, if hazardous waste is discharged during transport the transporter must:

1. Take appropriate immediate action to protect health and the environment, such as notifying authorities and diking the discharge
2. Make the required federal notifications and reports
3. Clean up the discharge, or take action so it no longer presents a hazard

## Training

Drivers hauling waste need DOT hazmat training and should understand the manifest. [[403]] and [[580]] cover both.`,
