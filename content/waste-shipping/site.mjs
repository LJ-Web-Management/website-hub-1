## Who's a hazmat employee?

Anyone who, in the course of their job, directly affects hazmat transportation safety. For waste shipments that includes people who:

- Classify the waste for shipping
- Select or fill packaging
- Mark and label containers
- Prepare or sign the manifest
- Load or block and brace containers

## What 49 CFR 172.704 requires

| Component | Covers |
|---|---|
| General awareness | The hazmat regulations and how to recognize hazmat |
| Function-specific | The exact tasks the employee does |
| Safety | Emergency response information, protecting yourself, avoiding accidents |
| Security awareness | Security risks and how to recognize threats |
| In-depth security | Required if your company must have a security plan |

## When

- **Within 90 days** of starting a hazmat job. Until then, work only under the direct supervision of a trained employee.
- **At least every three years** after that, and when regulations or the job change.

## Records

Keep a record for each employee: name, completion date, training materials or description, trainer's name and address, and certification that the employee was trained and tested. Keep it for as long as they're employed and 90 days after.

      courses: [403, 580, 601],
      body: `Your waste vendor's driver is on the way. Here's the order of operations that keeps the shipment legal.

## 1. Profile and classify

The waste has an approved profile with the destination facility. You know the EPA waste codes and the DOT description: proper shipping name, hazard class, UN number and packing group.

## 2. Package

Use DOT-authorized packaging for the material, usually UN-specification drums or totes, in good condition and compatible with the contents. Closures tight.

## 3. Mark

Each container of 119 gallons or less needs the **hazardous waste marking** under 40 CFR 262.32:

> HAZARDOUS WASTE — Federal Law Prohibits Improper Disposal. If found, contact the nearest police or public safety authority or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Plus the generator's name and address, EPA ID number, manifest tracking number and EPA waste codes. Also the DOT markings: proper shipping name and UN number.

## 4. Label

DOT hazard labels for the hazard class, such as Flammable Liquid 3 or Corrosive 8.

## 5. Placards

Offer the right placards to the transporter if they don't already have them.

## 6. Manifest

Prepare the manifest (or e-Manifest), with a land disposal restriction (LDR) notice with the first shipment of each waste stream. Check every line against what's on the truck. Then sign.

## 7. Keep records

Keep your signed copy and track the return copy from the destination facility.

      description: "The LDR notice is one of the most overlooked shipping documents. What it is and when you need one.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [601, 580],
      body: `Hazardous waste generally can't be land-disposed until it's treated to meet EPA standards. The **land disposal restriction (LDR)** program in 40 CFR Part 268 enforces that, and generators play a part through paperwork.

## What the generator does

Under 40 CFR 268.7, the generator determines whether its waste must be treated before land disposal, and tells the receiving facility.

- **Send a one-time written notice** with the initial shipment of each waste to each treatment or storage facility.
- **Keep a copy** in your files.
- **Send a new notice** when the waste or the receiving facility changes.

## What the notice says

Typically the EPA waste codes, the manifest number of the first shipment, the waste's treatability group, any underlying hazardous constituents for characteristic wastes, and whether the waste meets treatment standards or needs treatment.

## Who prepares it

Many waste vendors prepare LDR notices for you, but **the generator is responsible** for their accuracy. Read before you sign.

## Common problems

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| No notice on file for an old waste stream | Ask your vendor for the original or send a new one |
| Underlying constituents missing for D001 or D002 wastes | Review the profile and add them |
| Notice never updated after a process change | Re-profile and send a new notice |`,
