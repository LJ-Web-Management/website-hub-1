      body: `Servers pull cool air in the front and push hot air out the back. Airflow management keeps those two streams from mixing.

## The layout

Racks face each other across a **cold aisle** (fronts, supply air) and back onto a **hot aisle** (exhausts). Cooling units take return air from the hot side.

## Common leaks

- **Missing blanking panels** in empty rack spaces let hot exhaust recirculate to the front
- **Open cable cutouts** in raised floors waste supply air
- **Gaps between racks** and at row ends
- **Perforated tiles in the wrong place**, such as in hot aisles

## Containment

Cold aisle containment encloses the cold aisle; hot aisle containment encloses the hot aisle and ducts it back. Either one lets you raise supply temperatures and save energy.

## Measure it

Check rack inlet temperatures at the top, middle and bottom. ASHRAE's recommended inlet range for most IT equipment is 18–27 °C (64.4–80.6 °F).

      body: `Many sites still run supply air far colder than IT equipment needs. Every degree warmer means more economizer hours and less chiller energy.

## Before you change anything

1. Finish airflow management first: blanking panels, sealing, containment
2. Map rack inlet temperatures across the room
3. Check equipment specs for anything unusually sensitive

## Make the change

- Raise setpoints in small steps, about 1 °C at a time
- Wait and watch inlet temperatures, fan speeds and alarms after each step
- Stop when the hottest inlets approach the top of the recommended range

## Watch for

- **Server fans speeding up**, which can eat into the savings
- **Hot spots** at the tops of racks and row ends
- **Humidity**: check dew point limits as well as temperature

Document each step so you can roll back if needed. Troubleshooting skills help when the room doesn't respond as expected ([[836]]).`,
