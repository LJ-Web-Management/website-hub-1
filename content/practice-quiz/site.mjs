      body: `The final exam checks that you understood the course. These habits help.

## While you study

1. **Take notes on numbers.** Training hours, oxygen percentages, refresher frequency, LEL alarm settings.
2. **Draw the site zones.** Exclusion, contamination reduction and support zones, with the decon line.
3. **Learn the PPE levels** by what changes between them: respiratory protection and skin protection.
4. **Do every module quiz.** They show you what the exam focuses on.

## The night before

Review your notes, especially numbers and definitions. Get some sleep.

## During the exam

- Read the whole question before the answers
- Watch for "not," "except" and "always"
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
- Don't rush. The course is self-paced.

## Practice

The quiz above covers ten of the most common topics. If you can get eight or more right, you're on track.
