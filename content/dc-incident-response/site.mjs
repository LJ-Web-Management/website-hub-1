      body: `## 1. Life safety

If there's fire, smoke, an injury or a suppression discharge, evacuate and call emergency services. Equipment comes second.

## 2. Assess

- What alarms are active? What changed?
- What has the load lost: a path, a UPS, cooling?
- Is it spreading or stable?

## 3. Stabilize

Follow the EOP for the situation. Don't improvise switching on live systems. If you're unsure, stop and escalate.

## 4. Escalate and communicate

Call the on-call manager and the right vendors. Start an incident log with times. Tell customers or IT what's affected, what you're doing and when the next update is.

## 5. Preserve evidence

Don't reset alarms or clear event logs until they're recorded. They're needed for root cause.

## After

Hold a blameless post-incident review, find the root cause, and fix procedures, training or design.

      body: `An **emergency power off (EPO)** button removes power from IT equipment in a room so firefighters and responders can work safely. Accidental presses have caused major outages.

## Common causes

- Mistaken for a door release or light switch
- Bumped by carts or ladders
- Pressed by visitors or contractors who don't know what it is

## Prevention

- **Protective covers** that must be lifted before pressing
- **Clear labels** in plain language
- **Location**: near exits but away from door releases
- **Training** for everyone who enters the room, including contractors
- **Alarms** that sound when the cover is lifted

## If it happens

Follow the restore procedure: confirm why it was pressed, verify it's safe, and restore power in a planned sequence, not all at once. See [[853]].`,
