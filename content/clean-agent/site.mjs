      body: `Most clean agent systems use a two-stage alarm: an alert on the first detector, then a **pre-discharge** alarm with a countdown (often 30 seconds) when a second detector confirms.

## Do

- **Leave the room immediately** by the nearest exit
- **Close doors behind you**: the agent only works if it stays in the room
- **Report** to your supervisor and the assembly point
- **Call** emergency services if there's a fire

## Abort switch

The abort (hold) switch pauses the countdown while held. Only trained, authorized people should use it, and only when they've confirmed there's no fire. Know how your system behaves: some restart the countdown when released.

## Don't

- Stay to "see what's happening"
- Re-enter after discharge until the room is ventilated and declared safe
- Prop doors open

      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [854, 853],
      body: `| | Halocarbon agents | Inert gas agents |
|---|---|---|
| Examples | HFC-227ea (FM-200), FK-5-1-12 (Novec 1230) | IG-541 (Inergen), IG-55, IG-100 (nitrogen) |
| How they work | Mostly absorb heat from the fire | Lower oxygen to a level that won't support combustion |
| Storage | Liquefied in cylinders | High-pressure gas, many cylinders |
| People hazards | Decomposition products in a fire, cold discharge, noise | Reduced oxygen, noise, pressure |

## Common to both

- Pressurized cylinders that must be secured
- Room integrity: the room must hold the agent concentration
- **Impairments**: when the system is disabled for work, the space needs a fire watch or alternate protection and the right people must be notified

## Working in protected rooms

Before work near detectors or that creates dust or heat, follow the site's procedure to place the system in a safe mode, and return it to service afterwards. See [[853]] for how suppression ties into EPO.`,
