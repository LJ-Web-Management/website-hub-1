      title: "Cal/OSHA vs federal OSHA HAZWOPER: what's different in California",
      description: "The training hours match, but the rule, the exposure limits and the agencies don't. Here's what changes when you work in California.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [577, 578],
      body: `California is a state-plan state. Federal OSHA approved Cal/OSHA to run its own program, and in California the HAZWOPER rule is **Title 8, California Code of Regulations, section 5192**. It mirrors 29 CFR 1910.120 closely, but it isn't identical.

## What's the same

- **Training hours.** 40 hours plus three supervised field days for general site workers, 24 hours plus one day for limited-exposure workers, eight more hours for supervisors and eight hours of refresher every year.
- **Structure.** Site characterization, site safety and health plan, PPE, monitoring, medical surveillance, decon and emergency response all appear in the same order.

## What's different

| Topic | Federal | California |
|---|---|---|
| HAZWOPER rule | 29 CFR 1910.120 | 8 CCR 5192 |
| Exposure limits | 29 CFR 1910.1000 tables | 8 CCR 5155, Table AC-1, often lower |
| Respiratory protection | 29 CFR 1910.134 | 8 CCR 5144 |
| Public employees | Not covered by federal OSHA | Covered by Cal/OSHA |
| Hazardous waste agency | US EPA | DTSC, plus local CUPAs |

## Why the exposure limits matter

Cal/OSHA updates its permissible exposure limits more often than federal OSHA, and many are lower. A site that's "below the PEL" under federal tables can be above it under California's. That changes respirator decisions, monitoring action levels and whether a worker counts as exposed. A California course teaches the limits you'll actually be held to.

## Heat

California has its own outdoor heat illness prevention standard (8 CCR 3395), and heat is a top hazard for anyone in chemical protective clothing. Expect California training and site plans to spend real time on it.

## Do I need a California certificate?

Cal/OSHA cares that your training covered what 5192 requires. A federal certificate isn't automatically invalid in California. But a course written to Title 8 is the easiest record to defend in an inspection, especially for the annual refresher.

      title: "California hazardous waste rules: DTSC, CUPAs and the waste federal EPA doesn't count",
      description: "Why California generators manage more waste as hazardous, who inspects them and what staff need to know.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1051],
      body: `If you've managed hazardous waste in another state, California will feel familiar, with more of it. The state runs its own program under **Title 22, Division 4.5**, authorized by US EPA, and it's broader than federal RCRA.

## Who's in charge

- **DTSC**, the Department of Toxic Substances Control, writes the rules and permits treatment, storage and disposal facilities.
- **CUPAs**, Certified Unified Program Agencies, are usually county environmental health or fire departments. They inspect most generators.

Your inspector is probably from the CUPA, not DTSC or EPA.

## Waste that's hazardous only in California

California has its own tests and lists, so some waste that's non-hazardous federally is hazardous here. These are often called "non-RCRA" or "California-only" hazardous wastes. Common examples:

- **Used oil**, which California regulates as hazardous waste
- Wastes that fail California's own toxicity tests (the TTLC and STLC limits)
- Some wastes that are toxic to aquatic life under California's fish bioassay test

Staff who sort waste need to know these exist. Otherwise a "non-hazardous" drum leaves the site illegally.

## What generator staff must know

Every California generator needs people who can:

1. Identify which of their waste streams are hazardous
2. Use the right containers, keep them closed and label them with the accumulation start date
3. Stay within accumulation time limits for their generator category
4. Run satellite accumulation correctly at the point of generation
5. Sign a manifest and know what they're certifying
6. Respond to a spill using the facility's procedures

## Training records

Large quantity generators need documented, job-specific training for everyone who handles hazardous waste, with annual review. CUPAs commonly ask to see these records. Smaller generators still have to make sure staff know proper handling and emergency procedures. A short course with a certificate is the simplest way to show it.

      title: "Moving to a California job with an out-of-state HAZWOPER certificate",
      description: "Your 40-hour likely still counts. Here's what California employers check, and when a Cal/OSHA course is the smart move.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [578, 577, 576],
      body: `Crews follow the work, and plenty of California HAZWOPER jobs go to people trained in Texas, Nevada or Arizona. Do you need to start over? Usually not.

## What Cal/OSHA looks at

Cal/OSHA doesn't keep a list of approved providers or reject certificates from other states. 8 CCR 5192 asks whether the worker's training covered the required topics and hours, and whether the employer can show it. Like the federal rule, it lets an employer accept equivalent prior training if they document it.

So a valid federal 40-hour certificate plus a current refresher is generally a sound starting point.

## Where gaps show up

- **Exposure limits.** Your training taught federal PELs. California's are often lower. Your new site's safety plan will use the California numbers.
- **Heat illness.** California's heat rule is specific about water, shade, rest and acclimatization. Expect a site-specific briefing.
- **Agencies.** Spills and waste go to DTSC, the CUPA, the Regional Water Board and the local fire department, not just "the EPA."

## The simple fix

When your next annual refresher comes up, take [[578]]. It covers the 8-hour annual requirement and fills in the California differences. Your new certificate then references the rule your inspector will cite.

## If your certificate has lapsed

If your refresher is more than 12 months old, you're out of compliance until you finish one. If it's been years, your new employer may ask you to retake the initial course. In that case take [[577]], or [[576]] if your role is limited-exposure.

## Bring your records

Bring your initial certificate, every refresher, any supervisor certificate, your respirator fit test and your medical clearance. Missing paperwork is the most common reason a qualified worker gets sent back to class.`,
