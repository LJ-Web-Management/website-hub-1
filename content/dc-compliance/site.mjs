| Topic | Program | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| Generators | Clean Air Act (state air permits, EPA engine rules) | Permits, run-hour limits, emissions, recordkeeping |
| Diesel storage | SPCC (40 CFR 112) | Oil spill prevention plans above storage thresholds |
| Fuel tanks | UST rules (40 CFR 280) for underground tanks | Leak detection, corrosion protection |
| Refrigerants | Clean Air Act Section 608 | Technician certification, leak repair, recordkeeping |
| Batteries, lamps | Universal waste (40 CFR 273) | Labeling, accumulation time, shipping |
| Other wastes | RCRA | Waste determination and generator status |
| Chemicals on site | EPCRA Tier II | Annual reporting of stored chemicals (batteries and fuel often trigger it) |
| Stormwater | Clean Water Act permits | Construction and some industrial sites |

## Who owns it?

Assign an owner for each program, keep a compliance calendar, and train the people whose daily work creates the records.

      body: `## Do you need one?

Facilities generally need an SPCC plan if they have more than 1,320 gallons of aboveground oil storage (counting containers of 55 gallons or more) or more than 42,000 gallons underground (not counting tanks regulated under the UST rules), and could reasonably discharge oil to navigable waters or shorelines. Generator base tanks and day tanks count.

## What's in it

- Facility diagram with every oil container
- Secondary containment for tanks and the fuel delivery area
- Inspection and testing schedules
- Spill response procedures and contacts
- Training records for oil-handling staff
- Professional engineer certification (unless the facility qualifies to self-certify)

## Day to day

- Attend every fuel delivery
- Inspect tanks and containment
- Drain rainwater from containment only after checking for sheen
- Annual spill prevention briefings for oil-handling personnel

See [[416]] for spill prevention and response training.`,
