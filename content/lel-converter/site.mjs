      body: `Catalytic bead LEL sensors respond differently to different gases. A meter calibrated on methane will over- or under-read other gases.

## Correction factors

Manufacturers publish **correction factors** (or response factors): multiply the reading by the factor to estimate the true %LEL for the gas being measured. They are specific to each sensor model, so use your manufacturer's table.

## Rules of thumb

- Many heavier hydrocarbons (like pentane, hexane or fuel vapors) read **low** on a methane-calibrated sensor, which is the dangerous direction
- Some sites calibrate on pentane or propane to be conservative for a range of vapors
- Infrared LEL sensors behave differently and can't see some gases (like hydrogen) at all

## Also watch for

- Oxygen below about 10% makes catalytic sensors read low or zero
- Silicones, lead and sulfur compounds can poison catalytic sensors

| Purpose | Confirms sensors respond and alarms work | Adjusts the meter to read accurately against a known gas |
| When | Before each day's use (common industry practice and many manufacturers' recommendation) | On the manufacturer's schedule, or when a bump test fails |
| Gas | Known concentration, briefly | Known concentration, until readings stabilize |
| Result | Pass or fail | Meter adjusted |

## Record both

Keep records of every bump test and calibration. If an incident happens, they show the meter was working.

## If a bump test fails

Calibrate and bump again. If it still fails, take the meter out of service. See [[1056]].`,
