## One-page field summary

Put the site map with zones, PPE by task, action levels, the emergency signal, muster point, nearest hospital route and phone numbers on one laminated page.

## Action levels as decisions

"If the PID reads above X for Y minutes in the breathing zone, upgrade to Level C" is clearer than a table of exposure limits.

## Write for today's tasks

If drilling ends next week and excavation starts, update the hazard analysis and brief the crew.

## Brief it every day

Pre-entry briefings are required, and they're where the plan becomes real. Ask the crew questions to check they understood.

## Keep it current

Update the plan when conditions, tasks or contaminants change, and record the change.

      body: `29 CFR 1910.120(b)(4)(iv) requires inspections by the site safety and health supervisor, or another qualified person, to check that the plan is being followed and is effective.

## What to inspect

- Are workers in the right PPE for their task?
- Are monitors calibrated, bump tested and in use?
- Are zone boundaries marked and respected?
- Is decon set up and working?
- Are emergency equipment and communications ready?
- Are training and medical records current for everyone on site?

## When to update the plan

- New contaminants or higher concentrations found
- New tasks or equipment
- Changes in weather or season that affect hazards
- After any incident or near miss
- When inspections find the plan isn't working

## Document it

Record each inspection, what was found, what was fixed and any plan revision. Brief the crew on every change.
