      body: `## Put kits where spills start

- Fuel dispensers and generator day tanks
- Drum and tote storage
- Loading docks and transfer points
- Maintenance bays and parts washers
- Chemical storage rooms and battery rooms

## Within reach

Staff should be able to reach a kit in under a minute. Many facilities aim for a kit within about 50 feet of each spill-prone area.

## Between the spill and the drain

Place kits so the first thing a responder grabs, usually a drain cover and socks, is on the way to the nearest drain.

## Visible and clear

Label kits clearly, mount signs above them and keep them free of pallets and clutter.

## Matched to the area

A battery room needs acid neutralizer. A fuel island needs oil-only absorbents. Use the sizer above for each area.

## Checklist

- Seal intact, or contents verified if opened
- Absorbent socks, pads and pillows present and dry
- Drain cover present and not cracked
- Gloves and goggles present, not brittle or expired
- Disposal bags and ties present
- Neutralizers present and in date (for chemical kits)
- Instructions and emergency numbers inside the lid
- Kit labeled and unobstructed
- Inspection date and initials recorded

## After use

Restock the same day. A used kit with half its contents is worse than none, because people assume it's ready.

## Disposal

Used absorbents take on the hazards of what they absorbed. Bag, label and manage them as waste under your facility's procedures.
