      body: `A **concurrently maintainable** site lets you take any single component or distribution path out of service for planned work without shutting down IT equipment.

## What that looks like

- Two power paths to every rack, so one can be de-energized for breaker or switchgear work
- Isolation valves on chilled water loops, so a section can be drained
- Spare capacity (N+1) so a chiller, UPS module or generator can come offline

## Where sites fall short

- A single shared component nobody noticed: one fuel line, one control panel, one valve
- Single-corded equipment plugged into one path only
- Procedures that assume both paths are always up

## Operations matter as much as design

A Tier III design run without switching procedures, method of procedure (MOP) documents and trained staff doesn't deliver Tier III results.

      body: `Redundancy means having spares. **Fault tolerance** means a failure anywhere doesn't reach the IT load, without anyone having to act.

## What Tier IV adds

- **Simultaneously active paths**, not a standby path waiting to be switched in
- **Compartmentalization**: paths physically separated so a fire or flood in one room can't take out both
- **Continuous cooling**, so a power transfer doesn't let temperatures spike
- **Autonomous response**: the system rides through a failure on its own

## The trade-offs

Fault tolerance costs capital, space and efficiency. Many organizations instead spread workloads across multiple Tier III sites and rely on disaster recovery ([[844]]).`,
