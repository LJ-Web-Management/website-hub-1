      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [601, 600],
      body: `Your RCRA training duties depend on how much hazardous waste you generate in a calendar month. Count it, find your category, then match your training to it.

## The categories

| Category | Hazardous waste per month | Acute hazardous waste per month |
|---|---|---|
| Very small quantity generator (VSQG) | 100 kg or less | 1 kg or less |
| Small quantity generator (SQG) | More than 100 kg, less than 1,000 kg | 1 kg or less |
| Large quantity generator (LQG) | 1,000 kg or more | More than 1 kg |

100 kg is about half a 55-gallon drum of water-weight liquid. 1,000 kg is about five drums.

## LQG: formal, documented, annual

40 CFR 262.17(a)(7) is the most detailed requirement:

- Personnel must complete training **within six months** of starting a hazardous waste job, and can't work unsupervised until they do.
- The training must teach them to do their jobs in compliance and to respond to emergencies.
- Staff must take part in an **annual review** of the training.
- You must keep written records: each job title, the name of the person in it, a job description, and the type and amount of training each person gets. Keep records on current staff until closure and on former staff for three years.

## SQG: thorough familiarity

Under 40 CFR 262.16(b)(9)(iii), SQGs must make sure employees are "thoroughly familiar with proper waste handling and emergency procedures" for their jobs. There's no fixed format or schedule, but you have to be able to show it. A course with a certificate is the easiest proof.

## VSQG: no federal training rule

VSQGs have no federal RCRA training requirement. Your state may add one, and your workers may still need OSHA hazard communication or HAZWOPER training.

> Episodic events, such as a cleanout or a one-time spill, can bump you into a higher category for a month. Plan training for the category you could reach, not just your normal month.

## Building the plan

- Everyone who handles waste: [[601]], then [[600]] every year
- Satellite area users: [[415]]
- Anyone who signs manifests: [[580]], and DOT training via [[403]]
- Emergency coordinators: [[412]]`,

      slug: "satellite-accumulation-area-rules",
      title: "Satellite accumulation areas: the rules inspectors check first",
      description: "Satellite areas are small, scattered and run by people who aren't waste specialists. That's why they're cited so often.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [415],
      body: `A satellite accumulation area, or SAA, is a container at or near the point where waste is generated, under the control of the person running that process. It's where most hazardous waste begins. Inspectors know that, and SAAs are often the first stop on a walk-through.

## The rules in 40 CFR 262.15

1. **At or near the point of generation.** The waste container belongs at the process that creates the waste. A shared room down the hall usually doesn't count.
2. **Under the control of the operator.** The people adding waste must be able to control the area.
3. **Volume limit.** Up to 55 gallons of hazardous waste, or 1 quart of liquid acute hazardous waste, or 1 kg of solid acute hazardous waste.
4. **Marked.** Each container must say "Hazardous Waste" and indicate the hazards of the contents, for example with a hazard class label, GHS pictogram or NFPA diamond.
5. **Closed.** Keep containers closed except when adding, removing or consolidating waste.
6. **Good condition and compatible.** No leaks, rust or bulging, and the container material must suit the waste.

## The three-day rule

If you go over the limit, mark the container with the date the excess began. You then have **three consecutive calendar days** to move the excess to central accumulation, or to a treatment, storage or disposal facility. Weekends count.

## The violations we see most

- Funnels left in open containers
- "Waste" or "Used solvent" labels without the words "Hazardous Waste"
- No hazard indication
- Containers sitting in a hallway, far from the process
- Several partly full containers of the same waste, adding up to more than 55 gallons

> Satellite areas are run by operators, lab techs and mechanics. Train the people who actually fill the containers, not just EHS.

      slug: "signing-a-hazardous-waste-manifest",
      title: "What you're certifying when you sign a hazardous waste manifest",
      description: "The generator signature on the manifest is a legal certification. Here's what it means and how to protect it.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [580, 403],
      body: `The Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest (EPA Form 8700-22) follows your waste from your dock to its final destination. The signature in the generator box is a legal certification that carries your name, and it's often signed in a hurry.

## The certification

When you sign, you certify that the contents are "fully and accurately described above by the proper shipping name, and are classified, packaged, marked and labeled/placarded, and are in all respects in proper condition for transport according to applicable international and national governmental regulations."

You're also certifying your waste minimization statement. In plain words: you checked it, and it's right.

## You're also a DOT hazmat employee

Signing a manifest is preparing a hazardous materials shipping paper. Under 49 CFR 172.704, anyone who does that needs DOT hazmat employee training within 90 days of starting the job and at least every three years after. Many manifest signers have RCRA training but no DOT training. [[403]] covers both.

## e-Manifest

Since 2018, manifests are tracked in EPA's e-Manifest system. Receiving facilities submit them, and generators can sign electronically and see their manifests online. Register your site in EPA's RCRAInfo so you can see what's been filed under your EPA ID number.

## After the truck leaves

| Step | LQG | SQG |
|---|---|---|
| Signed copy from the TSDF not back | Contact the transporter and facility after 35 days | Wait up to 60 days |
| Still nothing | File an exception report by day 45 | Send a copy with a note to EPA or the state after 60 days |
| Keep copies | At least 3 years | At least 3 years |

## A five-minute pre-signing check

1. EPA ID numbers right for you, the transporter and the destination
2. Proper shipping name, hazard class and UN number match the profile
3. Container count and type match what's on the truck
4. Waste codes are complete
5. Containers labeled, marked and closed
