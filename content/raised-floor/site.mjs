      body: `## Before you lift

- Get permission, as lifted tiles affect airflow and may be under a change process
- Check what's underneath on drawings: power whips, chilled water, fire detection
- Set up barriers or cones around the opening

## Lifting

- Use a proper tile lifter (suction cups), not a screwdriver
- Lift one tile at a time, and don't remove too many adjacent tiles: the grid can lose stability
- Watch your back: some tiles are heavy

## While open

- **Never leave an open tile unattended.** Guard it or put it back
- Don't stand or kneel on the edge of the opening

## Under the floor

Most underfloor spaces aren't permit-required confined spaces, but deep plenums, poor ventilation or a suppression system discharge can change that. Follow your site's confined space evaluation (29 CFR 1910.146).

## Replacing

Seat tiles fully and level. Put perforated tiles back exactly where they came from.

      courses: [858],
      body: `Servers, storage arrays, UPS modules and batteries can be heavy, and racking them means lifting at awkward heights.

## Plan the lift

- Check the weight on the spec sheet or the box
- Remove drives, power supplies and other modules first to lighten it, if allowed
- Use a server lift or rack-mounted lift for heavy or high positions
- Use two people for anything heavy or awkward

## Lift right

- Keep the load close
- Lift with your legs, not your back
- Don't twist: turn your feet
- Avoid lifting above shoulder height without a lift

## Around the floor

- Use carts for moving equipment, and watch for floor point-load limits
- Clear packaging away promptly. Cardboard is a trip and fire hazard
- Keep aisles clear
