      description: "What new field techs should expect, from the HASP briefing to the decon line.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [590, 584],
      body: `You have your 40-hour certificate. Now comes the part the course can't give you: real days on a real site.

## Day one: paperwork and briefing

Expect to show your 40-hour certificate, refresher (if more than 12 months since the 40), medical clearance and respirator fit test. Then the pre-entry briefing: hazards, zones, PPE by task, action levels, emergency signals and muster point.

## Your field days

Under 29 CFR 1910.120(e)(3)(i), new general site workers need **three days** of field experience under a trained, experienced supervisor. That's this week. Ask questions. That's what it's for.

## Things nobody tells you

- **Bring extra layers and dry socks.** Tyvek and boots are hot in summer and cold in winter.
- **Hydrate before you suit up.** Water goes on the support side of the line.
- **Label your sample jars as you go.** Waiting until the end of the day causes mix-ups.
- **Learn the decon line both ways.** You'll go through it, and some days you'll run it.

## When to stop and ask

- A reading on the monitor you don't understand
- An unexpected drum, odor, sheen or stained soil
- Your PPE gets torn or soaked through
- You feel dizzy, sick or overheated

On a good site, stopping to ask is part of the job.`,

      title: "Action levels explained: what the PID reading means for you",
      description: "Most remediation PPE decisions come down to a few numbers in the HASP. Here's how to read them.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [583, 1056],
      body: `Every remediation health and safety plan has a table of action levels: readings that tell the crew when to keep working, upgrade PPE or stop. Understanding that table is one of the most useful things a field tech can learn.

## A typical action level table

| Breathing-zone reading (PID, sustained) | Action |
|---|---|
| Below 1 ppm above background | Continue in Level D |
| 1 to 5 ppm | Increase monitoring, consider Level C, identify the source |
| 5 to 50 ppm | Level C with organic vapor cartridges, if the contaminant allows |
| Above 50 ppm | Stop work, leave the area, call the site safety officer |

These numbers are only an example. **Your site's plan sets the real ones**, based on the contaminants present and their exposure limits.

## Key words

- **Breathing zone.** Measured near your nose and mouth, not at the ground.
- **Sustained.** Usually several minutes. A one-second spike isn't the trigger.
- **Above background.** Measured relative to clean air upwind.

## Why the PID isn't the whole story

A PID reads total volatile organics. It can't tell benzene from gasoline, and it doesn't see some chemicals at all. Sites with specific contaminants of concern use tubes, badges or lab samples to know what the PID number means.

## Oxygen and LEL first

In excavations and enclosed areas, check oxygen and LEL before trusting a PID reading. Low oxygen affects many sensors.

      title: "Finding drums on a cleanup site",
      description: "Buried or abandoned drums are one of the most dangerous surprises on a remediation job.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [590, 586],
      body: `Unknown drums turn a routine excavation into a hazmat situation. 29 CFR 1910.120(j) sets specific rules for handling them.

## When you find one

1. **Stop.** Don't touch, tip or puncture it.
2. **Back off** and tell your supervisor.
3. **Monitor the air** from a safe distance, upwind.
4. **Keep the area clear** until a plan is made.

## Why drums are dangerous

- Contents are often unknown and can be incompatible with each other.
- Rusted drums can collapse or leak when moved.
- Bulging drums may be pressurized.
- Some may contain shock-sensitive or reactive materials.

## What the rule requires

- Drums are inspected and their integrity assured before being moved, where practical.
- Unlabeled drums are treated as hazardous until characterized.
- Spill containment such as overpacks, absorbent and salvage drums is available where spills could occur.
- Drums that can't be moved safely are emptied in place into sound containers.
- Workers handling drums are trained for it, and only the minimum number of people are exposed.

## Equipment

Remote drum handling (grapplers, drum openers) and non-sparking tools are standard for unknown drums. Opening drums is done remotely or with shielding when contents might be pressurized or reactive.

> Drum handling isn't a task for a new hire's first week. Watch, learn and let the experienced crew lead.
