      body: `Ash from burned buildings isn't just wood ash. It can contain:

- **Heavy metals**: lead, arsenic, cadmium and others from paint, treated wood and electronics
- **Asbestos** from older building materials
- **Caustic ash** that can burn skin and eyes when wet
- **Household chemicals**: pesticides, pool chemicals, solvents, paints
- **Damaged lithium batteries** from vehicles, tools and home energy storage, which can reignite
- **Propane and compressed gas cylinders**

## Protect workers

- Respiratory protection: at minimum a properly fitted N95 for ash, and higher protection where asbestos or chemicals are present
- Long sleeves, gloves, goggles and boots
- Wet methods to keep dust down
- Decon before breaks and leaving the site

      description: "The first phase of cleanup, before debris removal.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [587, 1099],
      body: `After large wildfires, a first phase of cleanup often removes **household hazardous waste** from each property before general debris removal begins. It's usually run by government agencies and their contractors.

## Typical items

- Paints, solvents, cleaners and pool chemicals
- Pesticides and fertilizers
- Propane tanks and compressed gas cylinders
- Batteries, including lithium-ion
- Ammunition and fuel

## How crews work

1. Assess the property and look for hazards: unstable structures, sinkholes, hot spots
2. Identify and segregate materials
3. Package and label for transport
4. Document what was removed

## Training

Crews generally need HAZWOPER training appropriate to their tasks, plus site-specific training. See [[1099]] for awareness-level training for others working nearby.`,
