      body: `A **lab pack** is an outer container (usually a drum) holding many small containers of compatible chemicals, cushioned with absorbent.

## Steps

1. **Inventory** every container: name, amount, condition
2. **Identify** unknowns or poorly labeled containers before packing
3. **Segregate by compatibility**: acids, bases, oxidizers, flammables, water-reactives, poisons and so on
4. **Pack** each group in its own outer container with enough absorbent, inner containers upright and closed
5. **Record** a packing list for each drum
6. **Mark and label** the outer container, and prepare the manifest

## Watch for

- Peroxide formers (old ethers), picric acid and other shock-sensitive materials: don't move them, call a specialist
- Leaking or bulging containers
- Reactive or air-sensitive materials

      body: `Bulking (combining compatible waste from many containers into one) saves money but can cause fires, toxic gases or explosions if wastes react.

## Before you bulk

- Check profiles, labels and SDSs
- Run field compatibility tests on small samples: pH, water reactivity, oxidizer, flammability and others
- Mix small amounts first and watch for heat, gas, bubbling or color change

## When bulking

- Ground and bond containers for flammable liquids
- Use proper PPE and respiratory protection
- Work with air monitoring and ventilation
- Have spill and fire equipment ready

## Never

Bulk unknowns, or mix incompatible waste streams to "make them disappear." Decon your equipment after each job ([[584]]).`,
