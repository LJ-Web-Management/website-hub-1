      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [588, 586],
      body: `EPA defines a brownfield as a property whose expansion, redevelopment or reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant.

In plain terms: land that's probably contaminated, which makes building on it harder.

## Common brownfields

- Former gas stations and auto repair shops
- Old factories, foundries and rail yards
- Dry cleaners
- Former landfills and dumps
- Abandoned industrial and commercial buildings

## Common contaminants

Petroleum, chlorinated solvents, metals like lead and arsenic, PCBs, PAHs, and asbestos in old buildings.

## Why crews need HAZWOPER

When redevelopment includes digging up, moving or managing contaminated soil, or cleaning up under a state or federal program, the work is often a hazardous waste operation. Construction crews doing it fall under 29 CFR 1926.65.

## How projects usually run

1. Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments
2. A cleanup or soil management plan, often under a state voluntary cleanup program
3. Remediation, sometimes combined with construction
4. Engineering controls such as caps and vapor barriers built into the new development

      courses: [586, 590],
      body: `Before buying or redeveloping a property, buyers and lenders commission environmental site assessments.

## Phase I ESA

A Phase I looks for **recognized environmental conditions** without sampling. It reviews historical records, aerial photos, regulatory databases and interviews, and includes a site walk. Most are done under ASTM's Phase I standard (E1527) to support legal protections for buyers under federal law.

## Phase II ESA

If the Phase I finds concerns, a Phase II samples soil, groundwater, soil vapor or building materials to confirm whether contamination is there and how much.

## Why crews should read them

The ESAs tell you:

- **What contaminants** may be present, and where
- **Where the hot spots are**: old tanks, stained areas, former process areas
- **What's been found in samples**, which drives monitoring and PPE

Ask the project team for the ESA summaries and the site health and safety plan before mobilizing.

## Surprises still happen

ESAs sample a small fraction of a site. Unknown tanks, drums and buried debris turn up during excavation. That's why crews need training to recognize them and stop work. See [[586]].`,

      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [1056, 597],
      body: `Volatile contaminants in soil and groundwater, such as petroleum and chlorinated solvents, can move up as vapor and into buildings. That's **vapor intrusion**, and it's one of the main long-term issues on redeveloped brownfields.

## How projects address it

- **Vapor barriers**: membranes installed under the slab
- **Sub-slab depressurization**: piping and fans that vent vapor from beneath the building
- **Passive venting** layers that can be made active later
- **Indoor air and sub-slab monitoring** after construction

## For construction crews

Installing these systems usually happens while the crew is working in or above contaminated soil. That means:

- Monitoring in excavations and utility trenches, where vapors collect. See [[1056]].
- PPE and action levels from the site health and safety plan
- Care not to puncture or damage membranes, which can compromise the system

## For site leads

Membranes, seams and penetrations get inspected before the slab is poured. Coordinate inspections, and document everything for the regulator. Site leads directing this work need supervisor training ([[597]]).`,
