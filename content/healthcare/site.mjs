      title: "EPA's hazardous waste pharmaceuticals rule, in plain language",
      description: "40 CFR 266 Subpart P changed how healthcare facilities manage pharmaceutical waste. The key points.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [601],
      body: `In 2019 EPA published management standards for hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at healthcare facilities and reverse distributors: **40 CFR Part 266, Subpart P**. Where states have adopted it, it replaces the standard generator rules for these wastes.

## The one rule that applies everywhere

**The sewering ban.** Healthcare facilities may not flush or drain hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. This part took effect nationally on August 21, 2019, even in states that hadn't adopted the rest of Subpart P.

## Who it covers

Healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, long-term care facilities and veterinary clinics, and reverse distributors. Facilities that are very small quantity generators can choose whether to use Subpart P for their pharmaceuticals.

## Key points

- **Two streams:** *non-creditable* hazardous waste pharmaceuticals (waste) and *potentially creditable* ones (going to a reverse distributor for manufacturer credit).
- **Accumulation:** non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals can be kept on site for up to one year.
- **Labels:** containers say "Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals."
- **Training:** personnel who manage these wastes must be thoroughly familiar with proper handling and emergency procedures.
- **Nicotine:** FDA-approved over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies such as patches and gum are no longer P075 acute hazardous waste.

## What to do

1. Check whether your state has adopted Subpart P.
2. Identify which of your pharmaceuticals are hazardous waste. Your pharmacy and waste vendor can help.
3. Train pharmacy, nursing and environmental services staff who handle pharmaceutical waste.
4. Make sure nothing hazardous goes down the drain.

      title: "Common hazardous wastes in hospitals, department by department",
      description: "Hazardous waste isn't just in the lab. A walk through where it's generated in a typical hospital.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [601, 415, 602],
      body: `When people think of hospital waste, they think of red bags and sharps. Those are regulated medical waste, mostly under state rules. **Hazardous waste** under RCRA is a separate stream, and it shows up all over the building.

## Department by department

| Department | Typical hazardous waste |
|---|---|
| Pharmacy | Certain chemotherapy drugs, warfarin, nicotine products other than OTC replacement therapies, expired hazardous drugs |
| Pathology and histology | Formalin, xylene, alcohols, stains |
| Clinical lab | Solvents, reagents, mercury-containing compounds |
| Radiology | Old fixer and developer solutions, lead aprons and shielding |
| Facilities and maintenance | Paints, solvents, used oil, aerosol cans |
| Biomed | Batteries, mercury devices, circuit boards |
| Environmental services | Some cleaning chemicals, mercury from broken thermometers |
| Everywhere | Fluorescent lamps and batteries (universal waste) |

## Why it matters

Mixing hazardous waste into regulated medical waste or trash is one of the most common healthcare violations, and incinerators for medical waste often aren't permitted for hazardous waste.

## Make it simple for staff

- Put the right container in the right place, labeled clearly.
- Use color-coding: many facilities use black for RCRA hazardous pharmaceuticals, yellow for trace chemo and red for biohazard. Follow your facility's own scheme.
- Train the people who fill containers, not only the people who ship them.

      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [601, 1099, 602],
      body: `RCRA training rules apply to **personnel who handle hazardous waste**, not just EHS. In a hospital that's a long list.

## Role by role

| Role | Suggested training |
|---|---|
| EHS and waste coordinators | [[601]], then [[600]] annually, plus [[412]] if you're an LQG |
| Pharmacists and pharmacy techs | [[601]] or [[415]], plus Subpart P training where adopted |
| Lab and histology techs | [[415]] |
| Environmental services | [[415]] and [[1099]] |
| Facilities, biomed and materials management | [[602]] |
| Security | [[1099]] |
| Anyone who signs a manifest | Generator training plus manifest and DOT training |

## How often

- Large quantity generators: within six months of starting the job, and an annual review.
- Small quantity generators: staff must be thoroughly familiar with handling and emergency procedures. Annual refreshers are a good habit.
- Universal waste: handlers must inform or train employees on handling and emergency procedures.

## Keep records

Inspectors from EPA or your state agency will ask who was trained, when and on what. Certificates filed by role make that a five-minute answer.`,
