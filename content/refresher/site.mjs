      description: "The 12-month clock, what happens when you're late and how to get back in compliance.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [595, 900],
      body: `OSHA's rule is short: covered workers "shall receive eight hours of refresher training annually" (29 CFR 1910.120(e)(8)). Everything else is interpretation. Here's how most employers and auditors read it.

## The 12-month clock

Count 12 months from the date on your last certificate, either your initial 40/24-hour or your last refresher. If your 40-hour certificate says March 3, 2026, your refresher is due by March 3, 2027.

Many employers line everyone up on one renewal month to make tracking easier. That's fine, as long as nobody goes more than 12 months between trainings.

## What if I'm late?

The standard has no grace period. If you're past 12 months, you're out of compliance until you finish a refresher. Two practical points:

- **A short lapse** (weeks or a few months) is normally fixed by taking the 8-hour refresher right away. Your new 12-month clock starts from the new certificate.
- **A long lapse** (years) is a judgment call for your employer. OSHA's equivalency rule, 1910.120(e)(9), lets an employer accept training and experience they can document. If you've been away from HAZWOPER work for a long time and can't show current competency, many employers will have you retake the initial course.

> Out of compliance means off the site. Most site safety plans won't let a worker with an expired refresher into the exclusion zone, so a lapse costs work days, not just paperwork.

## Can I take it early?

Yes. Taking it early just moves your next due date earlier.

## Does online count?

The refresher has no hands-on field component the way the initial 40-hour does. An online course that covers the required topics and lets you ask a qualified instructor questions is widely used for the annual refresher.

      title: "Which 8-hour refresher fits your job?",
      description: "Five refreshers, one requirement. A side-by-side guide to choosing the right one.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [595, 900, 596, 574, 598],
      body: `Every refresher on this site gives you the eight hours that 1910.120(e)(8) requires each year. The difference is what fills those eight hours.

## Side by side

| Refresher | Best for | Price |
|---|---|---|
| [[595]] | Any 40- or 24-hour worker | $89.99 |
| [[900]] | Workers in state-plan states | $84.99 |
| [[596]] | Supervisors and site leads | $149.99 |
| [[574]] | Responders and incident commanders | $159.99 |
| [[598]] | Ammonia refrigeration technicians | $109.99 |

## Three quick rules

1. **Took the supervisor course?** Take the supervisor refresher, so the leadership part of your training stays current too.
2. **On a response team?** Take the incident command refresher. Responders under paragraph (q) need yearly refresher training or a demonstration of competency, and this covers it in one go.
3. **Not sure?** The standard 8-hour refresher always meets the base requirement.

## Mixed crews

You don't have to put the whole crew in one course. A typical contractor puts most people in the standard refresher, foremen in the supervisor refresher and the response team in the incident command refresher. Everyone gets the same renewal date.`,

      slug: "state-plan-states-hazwoper-refresher",
      title: "State-plan states and the HAZWOPER refresher",
      description: "If your state runs its own OSHA program, does your refresher need to be different? Usually not, but here's when it matters.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [900, 595],
      body: `About half of US states run their own OSHA-approved occupational safety program, called a "state plan." State plans must be at least as effective as federal OSHA. For HAZWOPER, most simply adopt 29 CFR 1910.120 as written.

## When your state has its own version

A few states publish their own HAZWOPER rule. Examples include California (Title 8, section 5192), Washington (WAC 296-843) and Michigan (MIOSHA Part 432). The hours are the same as the federal rule: 40 or 24 hours initial, 8 hours a year. But the section numbers, some definitions and some details differ.

An inspector in those states will cite the state rule, not the federal one. A refresher that references the right rule makes your records easier to defend.

## Public employees

Federal OSHA doesn't cover state and local government workers, but state plans do. In a state-plan state, a county road crew or a municipal hazmat team is covered by HAZWOPER the same way a private contractor is. In federal-OSHA states, EPA's worker protection rule (40 CFR Part 311) applies HAZWOPER to public employees who'd otherwise be left out.

## What to do

- **Federal-OSHA state, or a state plan that adopts the federal rule:** [[595]] covers you.
- **State with its own HAZWOPER rule, or crews in several states:** [[900]] covers the federal rule and the state equivalents.
- **California specifically:** see our sister site [cal-osha.hazwoperosha.us](https://cal-osha.hazwoperosha.us/) for Cal/OSHA courses.
