      title: "The HAZWOPER program checklist for EHS managers",
      description: "Training is one piece. Here's every element an inspector expects a HAZWOPER program to have.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [597, 1016],
      body: `29 CFR 1910.120(b) requires employers with hazardous waste operations to have a **written safety and health program**. Training is a big part, but far from all of it.

## The checklist

- **Organizational structure.** Who's in charge, who's the site safety officer, lines of authority.
- **Comprehensive work plan.** Tasks, objectives, methods and personnel needed.
- **Site-specific safety and health plans** for each site.
- **Training program.** 40/24-hour initial, field experience, supervisor training and annual refreshers.
- **Medical surveillance program** under (f).
- **Standard operating procedures** for safety and health.
- **PPE program** under (g), including respiratory protection under 1910.134.
- **Exposure monitoring** under (h).
- **Site control** under (d).
- **Decontamination** under (k).
- **Emergency response plan** under (l), or (q) if you respond to emergencies.
- **Recordkeeping.** Training certificates, medical records, exposure records.

## The training piece

| Role | Requirement |
|---|---|
| General site workers | 40 hours + 3 days field, 8 hours a year |
| Limited-exposure workers | 24 hours + 1 day field, 8 hours a year |
| Supervisors | Plus 8 hours of supervisor training |
| Trainers | Qualified under (e)(5) |
| Responders | By (q) responder level, annually |

## Make it reviewable

Keep the program in one place, version it and review it at least annually or when operations change. When an inspector asks for "your HAZWOPER program," you should be able to hand it over in minutes.`,

      title: "Tracking training renewal cycles across your workforce",
      description: "Every rule has its own clock. A reference table for the cycles EHS teams track most.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [900, 601],
      body: `The hardest part of training compliance isn't the training. It's the calendar. Each rule renews on a different cycle.

## Common renewal cycles

| Requirement | Initial | Renewal |
|---|---|---|
| HAZWOPER site workers (1910.120(e)) | 40 or 24 hours before work | 8 hours every 12 months |
| HAZWOPER supervisors | +8 hours before supervising | Within the annual refresher |
| HAZWOPER responders (q) | By level before responding | Annually, or demonstrated competency |
| TSDF workers (p) | 24 hours | 8 hours every 12 months |
| RCRA LQG personnel | Within 6 months of assignment | Annual review |
| DOT hazmat employees | Within 90 days | At least every 3 years |
| Respirator fit test (1910.134) | Before use | Every 12 months |
| PSM operator refresher (1910.119) | Before operating | At least every 3 years |
| Medical surveillance (1910.120(f)) | Before assignment | Usually every 12 months |

## How to track it

1. Build a **training matrix**: people down the side, requirements across the top, due dates in the cells.
2. Flag anything due within **60 days**.
3. Align renewals where you can. For example, put the whole crew's HAZWOPER refresher and respirator fit test in the same month.
4. Keep certificates attached to the matrix, not in a separate drawer.

## Multi-state programs

If you operate in state-plan states, check whether the state has its own HAZWOPER rule. [[900]] covers federal and state-plan equivalents in one refresher.`,

      slug: "hazwoper-medical-surveillance",
      title: "HAZWOPER medical surveillance: who, when and what",
      description: "Paragraph (f) is easy to overlook and expensive to get wrong. The essentials.",
      date: "2026-10-25",
      courses: [597],
      body: `29 CFR 1910.120(f) requires a medical surveillance program for certain HAZWOPER workers. It's separate from training, but auditors look at both together.

## Who's covered

- Employees exposed, or potentially exposed, at or above the PEL (or published exposure levels if there's no PEL) for **30 days or more a year**, without regard to respirator use
- Employees who wear a respirator **30 days or more a year**, or as required by 1910.134
- Employees injured, ill or with symptoms from possible overexposure in an emergency
- Members of **HAZMAT teams**

## When exams happen

- Before assignment
- At least every **12 months**, unless the physician determines a longer interval (up to every 2 years) is appropriate
- At termination or reassignment, if no exam in the past 6 months
- As soon as possible after signs or symptoms of overexposure
- More often if the physician says so

## What you give the physician

A copy of the standard and its appendices, a description of the employee's duties and exposures, exposure levels, PPE used, and information from previous exams.

## What you get back

A written opinion: whether the employee has any condition that would put them at increased risk, any recommended limitations, and the results. The employer keeps medical records under 29 CFR 1910.1020 for the duration of employment plus 30 years.

## Practical tips

Align medical exams with fit tests and refreshers, and keep a single due-date list. Missing a medical clearance can take a trained worker off a site as surely as missing a refresher.`,
