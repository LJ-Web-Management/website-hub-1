      body: `## Assigned protection factor (APF)

The level of protection a respirator is expected to give workers when it's used as part of a proper respiratory protection program. An APF of 10 means the respirator should reduce the concentration inside the facepiece to about one tenth of the outside air.

| Respirator | APF (OSHA) |
|---|---|
| Half mask air-purifying | 10 |
| Full facepiece air-purifying | 50 |
| Loose-fitting PAPR | 25 |
| Full facepiece PAPR | 1,000 |
| SCBA, pressure-demand, full facepiece | 10,000 |

## Maximum use concentration (MUC)

**MUC = APF × exposure limit.** It's the highest concentration in which the respirator can be used.

## Limits on the MUC

- Air-purifying respirators can't be used in IDLH atmospheres or oxygen-deficient air
- Cartridges and filters have their own maximum concentrations
- APFs only apply with fit testing, training and maintenance

      body: `For gases and vapors, OSHA requires air-purifying respirators to have either an **end-of-service-life indicator** or a **change schedule** based on objective data.

## Building a schedule

Use the manufacturer's service-life software or data, with:

- The contaminants and their concentrations (from air monitoring, see [[1056]])
- Temperature and humidity
- Work rate and breathing rate

## Then

- Write the schedule into the respiratory protection program
- Build in a safety margin
- Change cartridges at least as often as the schedule says, or at the end of every shift if that's sooner for your conditions

## Don't rely on odor

Many chemicals have poor warning properties, or are only detectable by smell above their exposure limit.`,
