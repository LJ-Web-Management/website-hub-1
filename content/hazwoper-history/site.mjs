      body: `In the 1940s and early 1950s, a chemical company buried thousands of tons of chemical waste in an abandoned canal in Niagara Falls, New York. The site was later covered over, and a school and neighborhood were built on and around it.

By the late 1970s, residents were reporting chemicals seeping into basements and yards. In 1978, the state and federal governments declared emergencies, and hundreds of families were relocated.

## What changed

Love Canal showed there was no federal program to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites or make polluters pay. In 1980, Congress passed **CERCLA**, known as Superfund, to do both.

## The worker connection

Cleaning up thousands of Superfund sites meant sending workers into uncontrolled hazards. In 1986, the **Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA)** directed OSHA to write worker protection rules for that work. The result was HAZWOPER.

## Today

The training in your 40-hour course, from site characterization to decon, exists because of sites like Love Canal.

      body: `## 1986: the mandate

Section 126 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act told OSHA to issue standards protecting employees engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency response, and listed the topics they had to cover: site analysis, training, medical surveillance, protective equipment, monitoring, decontamination, emergency response and more.

## December 1986: interim rule

OSHA issued an interim final rule so protections applied while the permanent rule was developed.

## March 6, 1989: final rule

OSHA published the final standard, **29 CFR 1910.120**, with its familiar structure: cleanup sites, TSD facilities and emergency response. EPA published a parallel rule, 40 CFR Part 311, to cover state and local government employees in states without an OSHA state plan.

## March 6, 1990: effective

The standard took full effect one year after publication.

## Still current

The core of the rule, including the 40, 24 and 8-hour training requirements, has stayed the same since. That's why a certificate from any properly run course carries the same weight today.
